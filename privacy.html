      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains what information Civic Threat collects, how we use it, how we share it, and the choices you have

      <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat (“<strong>Civic Threat</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”) is operated by
        <strong>Civic Threat Productions</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Controller/Operator:</strong> Civic Threat Productions</li>
        <li><strong>Address:</strong> United States</li>
        <li><strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:ogdeig@protonmail.com">ogdeig@protonmail.com</a></li>
        <li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="/index.html">CivicThreat.us</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) What information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information in three main ways: (A) information you provide, (B) information collected automatically,
        and (C) information from third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>A) Information you provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact communications:</strong> If you email us or contact us, we may collect your name (if provided),
          your email address, and the contents of your message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content submissions:</strong> If you submit a post (for example, a Facebook embed code or a direct URL),
          we may collect the content you submit and any notes you include. Please do not submit sensitive personal information
          (such as Social Security numbers, financial account information, government IDs) or private data about others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Age/consent gating:</strong> Some sections may ask you to confirm you are an adult (for example, 21+).
          We may store a local preference/consent flag in your browser to remember your selection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B) Information collected automatically</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit the site, we may automatically collect basic technical and usage information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device &amp; browser data</strong> (device type, browser, operating system)</li>
        <li><strong>Log data</strong> (IP address, timestamps, pages visited, referral URL)</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (general navigation patterns and interactions)</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> derived from IP (city/region-level, not precise GPS)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C) Information from third parties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Embedded social content:</strong> Pages may embed content from third-party platforms (for example, Facebook).
          Those platforms may collect information about you according to their own privacy policies, especially if you are logged in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics and security providers:</strong> We may use services for analytics, performance, and security
          (such as CDN or DDoS protection) that process IP addresses and request metadata to deliver and protect the site.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Cookies, local storage, and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We may use cookies, <code>localStorage</code>, and similar technologies to remember preferences (for example, age-gate confirmation),
        maintain security, improve performance, and understand how the site is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies or local storage may affect site functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>4) How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate and maintain the site and its features (including PDF reader and text-to-speech tools)</li>
        <li>Review and moderate submitted content and enforce community standards</li>
        <li>Respond to inquiries and support requests</li>
        <li>Monitor performance, prevent abuse, detect fraud, and secure the site</li>
        <li>Understand traffic and improve site usability and content organization</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations and protect rights, safety, and property</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Legal bases (where required)</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, our processing may rely on:
        (a) legitimate interests (running, securing, improving the site; moderation and safety),
        (b) consent (where required for certain cookies/analytics or optional features),
        (c) contract (if subscriptions/accounts are offered in the future),
        and/or (d) legal obligations (valid legal requests and compliance).
      </p>

      <h2>6) Sharing information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information in the conventional sense. We may share information only in limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers:</strong> Hosting, security/CDN, analytics, communications, and other vendors that help us operate the site.
          They are permitted to use data only to perform services for us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Future subscriptions &amp; payments:</strong> If we offer subscriptions, payments will typically be handled by third-party
          processors. Civic Threat generally does not store full payment card numbers. We may receive limited metadata (transaction IDs, billing status)
          needed to manage subscriptions and prevent fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and safety:</strong> We may disclose information if reasonably necessary to comply with legal obligations,
          respond to valid legal process, protect safety, and enforce our policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business changes:</strong> If Civic Threat is reorganized or transferred, information may be transferred as part of that process.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) Public content, documents, and third-party embeds</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat may display embedded third-party posts and link to or host publicly available documents (including court PDFs).
        Third-party platforms may collect data when you interact with their embeds, according to their own policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some documents may contain explicit or disturbing material. Accessing such content is at your discretion and subject to any age-gating we apply.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal information only as long as reasonably necessary for site operations, moderation, security, compliance, and dispute resolution.
        We may retain certain logs longer where needed for security or legal reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies/local storage:</strong> You can limit cookies and local storage in your browser settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Some analytics may be limited through browser tools or opt-out features where available.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact:</strong> You can request access, correction, or deletion of certain data by contacting us (see Section 12).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage
        is 100% secure. You use the site at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided
        personal information, please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
      </p>
