      <h1>Advertising &amp; Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
      <p>
        Civic Threat believes in transparency. This page explains how we may earn revenue (now or in the future),
        how we label sponsored content, and how affiliate links work.
      </p>

      <div class="meta-row" aria-label="Policy metadata">
        <div class="meta-pill"><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 1, 2026</div>
        <div class="meta-pill"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 1, 2026</div>
      </div>
    </header>

    <section class="legal-card">
      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Plain-English summary:</strong> If we use ads or affiliate links, we’ll label them clearly.
        If you click an affiliate link and buy something, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.
        This document is not legal advice.
      </div>

      <h2>1) Operator</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat is operated by <strong>Civic Threat Productions</strong> (United States).
        Questions: <a href="mailto:ogdeig@protonmail.com">ogdeig@protonmail.com</a>
      </p>

      <h2>2) Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat may display advertising now or in the future. Ads may be delivered directly by us or through third-party ad networks.
        Ads may appear as banners, sponsored placements, promoted content, or other formats.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We aim to clearly separate ads from editorial content.</li>
        <li>Where required, we will label ads as “Advertisement,” “Sponsored,” or similar language.</li>
        <li>Ad networks may use cookies or similar technologies to measure performance or provide relevant ads.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Affiliate links</h2>
      <p>
        Some links on Civic Threat may be affiliate links. This means that if you click the link and purchase a product or service,
        we may receive a commission (or another form of compensation) from the merchant. This does not increase your price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where practical, we will disclose affiliate relationships near the relevant link(s) or on the page where affiliate links appear.
        Typical labels may include: “affiliate link,” “we may earn a commission,” or “sponsored link.”
      </p>

      <h2>4) Sponsored content &amp; partnerships</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat may publish sponsored content or partner content in the future. Sponsored content will be labeled clearly, such as:
        “Sponsored,” “Paid Partnership,” or “Presented by [Brand].”
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may accept compensation for sponsored posts, placements, or promotions.</li>
        <li>We may also receive free products or services for review or evaluation.</li>
        <li>We strive to maintain editorial independence and honest presentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Editorial independence and accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat covers public records, public discussion, and embedded third-party content. We may summarize, comment on, or discuss information,
        but we do not guarantee completeness or accuracy of third-party content. Sponsored relationships do not guarantee positive coverage.
      </p>

      <h2>6) External links and third-party platforms</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat may link to third-party websites or embed third-party content (e.g., social media posts). These third parties may have their own
        privacy policies and data practices. We do not control third-party sites, and you access them at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Changes to this Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this disclosure as our monetization methods evolve. Updates will be posted on this page and the “Last updated” date will change.
      </p>
