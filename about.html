      <h1>About Civic Threat</h1>
      <p>
        Civic Threat is a public hub built around <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>public records</strong>, and <strong>civil discussion</strong>.
        We organize publicly available “released files” (including court documents often searched as the <strong>Epstein files</strong>) and provide tools
        like an <strong>Epstein file reader</strong> that can display PDFs and read them aloud for accessibility.
        We also curate platform content so people can support creators, challenge misinformation, and debate responsibly — without promoting hate speech.
      </p>
    </header>

    <div class="cards">
      <section class="card" aria-label="What we do">
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
          We make it easier to browse, understand, and discuss information that’s already public — especially document releases and public-facing platform posts.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Released Files Library:</strong> a growing collection of publicly available documents (court filings and more).</li>
          <li><strong>PDF Reader + TTS:</strong> an in-browser viewer that can read released documents aloud, page-by-page.</li>
          <li><strong>Community submissions:</strong> submit platform posts for review so others can learn, support, or debate the claims.</li>
          <li><strong>Future expansions:</strong> additional released collections (for example, declassified “top secret” files that have been officially declassified and lawfully made public).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" aria-label="What we are not">
        <h2>What we are not</h2>
        <p>
          We are not a government agency, law enforcement, a court, or a political campaign. We don’t claim special access.
          We don’t “leak” private data. We focus on material that is <strong>public record</strong> or otherwise lawfully available.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> provide legal advice.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> encourage harassment, threats, or doxxing.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> endorse wrongdoing; we focus on access, context, and discussion.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> guarantee the accuracy of third-party content embedded from social platforms.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>

    <section class="section" aria-label="Released Files and Epstein files">
      <h2>Released Files, public records, and “Epstein files”</h2>
      <p>
        Many people search online for “Epstein files” looking for court PDFs and public case materials.
        Civic Threat provides a dedicated <strong>Epstein files reader</strong> so you can view released PDFs and optionally listen to them using text-to-speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because these materials are often sensitive, disturbing, or explicit, we may apply age-gating and content warnings.
        Accessing and interpreting public records is your responsibility — we provide tools and organization, not endorsements.
      </p>
      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Safety and privacy reminder:</strong> Do not use Civic Threat to identify, target, or harass anyone.
        Do not share private personal data. Public records can still contain sensitive information — handle responsibly.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-label="Platform posts and community moderation">
      <h2>Platform posts, debate, and moderation</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Threat curates and organizes posts from major platforms to help people follow narratives, support creators, and challenge claims.
        This includes posts from across the political spectrum — including supporters and critics of major movements and public figures —
        because the goal is informed discussion, not echo chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We review submissions and moderate content to reduce hate speech and targeted harassment.
        We may reject or remove submissions that violate our standards, create safety risks, or appear to be posted in bad faith.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> context, transparency, and civil discourse</li>
        <li><strong>Not allowed:</strong> hate speech, threats, doxxing, harassment, or incitement</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> debate the ideas and claims — not target private individuals</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-label="How we protect ourselves and you">
      <h2>How we “cover our butts” (and why that protects users too)</h2>
      <p>
        We take compliance and safety seriously. Civic Threat is designed to reduce risk by focusing on public records, lawful sources, and moderation.
        We also publish clear policies (Privacy, Terms, DMCA, Cookies, Advertising Disclosure) so expectations are transparent.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public record focus:</strong> We emphasize publicly available or lawfully accessible materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation controls:</strong> We can remove or reject unsafe or abusive submissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party independence:</strong> Embeds remain controlled by the platform that hosts them.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility tooling:</strong> TTS is for reading/accessibility; it may misread text and is not a source of “truth.”</li>
      </ul>
