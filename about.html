Civic Threat is a public-interest website focused on transparency, public records, and civil discussion. We collect and organize content from major social platforms and public sources so people can browse, learn, debate, and verify information in one place—without promoting hate speech, harassment, or violence.

Our goal is simple: make public information easier to find, easier to understand, and easier to discuss responsibly.

Released Files Library

Civic Threat includes a growing library of publicly available documents—including released court PDFs commonly searched as the “Epstein files”—and a built-in Epstein PDF reader with text-to-speech (TTS) so visitors can listen page-by-page for accessibility and easier review.

We also publish and organize declassified top secret files (materials that have been officially declassified and lawfully made public), including CIA-style releases and other government or investigative records that are publicly available.

Important context:

Some documents may contain graphic, disturbing, or sexually explicit descriptions.

Documents are provided for public awareness, research, commentary, accessibility, and discussion.

Civic Threat does not endorse wrongdoing and does not encourage harassment of any person.

Where It Started: Social Channels & Public Debate

Civic Threat started as a social-first project. We track and discuss posts across viewpoints—including content from people who support Trump and people who don’t—because we believe the healthiest communities rely on primary sources, open debate, and strong moderation.

We’re not here for hate or pile-ons. We’re here to:

surface content people are already discussing,

provide additional context when possible,

encourage civil disagreement, and

keep the conversation focused on facts and accountability.

Submitting Posts to Civic Threat

Users may submit social posts (including embed codes or links) for potential inclusion on the site. Submissions are reviewed before publication.

By submitting content, you confirm that:

the material is publicly available or you otherwise have the right to submit it;

you understand Civic Threat may edit, summarize, categorize, or reject any submission; and

Civic Threat may remove content at any time for any reason, including moderation, compliance, accuracy, or safety.

Moderation & Community Standards
