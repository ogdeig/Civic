I do believe that a white \nboard and projector for mac and pc are needed. basic \ndrinks, snacks... \nI have no information on how people will arrive, what is happening to \nthe spouses/partners. Can't just \"dump them,\" so some \nthings would be nice to be set up. What sort of other \nrelaxing activities will be there. What happens when people \narrive, that night, etc. \nWe wanted to arrange for one of the people to do a gourmet bbq and \ntalk about the science of cooking on one of the nights at \nJeffs island... (but that would have to be arranged) \nneed to know about meals (both for the attendees as well as their \nguests). When they can join and when they can not. \nIf you want to call to discuss, I would be happy to arrange a time. \nPerhaps, we can work somethings out on the above, and \nthen, Jeff doesn't have to think about it? \nAppreciative of your understanding in the above. \nEFTA R1_00497765 \nEFTA02001055\nYours, \nAl \nFrom: Cecile de Jongh <ceciledeionuh@vahoo.com>\nTo: Al Seckel \nSent: Tue, December 21, 2010 9:58:06 AM \nSubject: Fw: MINDSHIFT \nAl, \nIf you have no preference on room set up, do you want me to just \narrange that?

      "body": "Hi Jeffrey. I thought our call with Deloitte was quite productive. Pleas= note that, as described below, \nthe insurance analogy is not helpful. The reason is that there is a specific rule with insurance. The fact that there is an \nexpress carve-out for insurance, but not in the substituti=n scenario, suggests that we should not use the former as \nanalogy to support the latter. \nTax Regs. Sec. 526.7(a)(5) provides the following, along with two examples:=/font> \nThe term \"sale\" does not apply to the transfer of tangible personal pro=erty to a carrier, repairman, \nwarehouseman or insurer by the owner of the proper=y after payment for damages thereto or loss thereof. \nExample 1: A carrier while transporting tangible personal property for a customer, damages the \nproperty. The carrier then make a cash payment to the customer for the amount the customer paid for the property, \nand retains the damaged property. The retention of the property by the carrier is not a sale. \n3 \nEFTA_R1_01746296 \nEFTA02575102\nExample 2: A motor vehicle is damaged in an accident, and the insurer consi=ers it a total loss.

The carrier then make a cash payment to the customer for the amount the customer paid for the property, \nand retains the damaged property. The retention of the property by the carrier is not a sale. \n3 \nEFTA_R1_01746296 \nEFTA02575102\nExample 2: A motor vehicle is damaged in an accident, and the insurer consi=ers it a total loss.

I didn't want to bother anyone with my \npersonal problems but I see now that was a bad move. I reached out to Sue and Sarah on tues \nabout the when was the next day I can plan to cook for you and they were unsure. Its again my \nfault for not comunicating that I was very ill to someone. I have discharge papers and doctors \nnotes if someone needs to see them. \nI am however back in full swing of things as of yesterday and can send jerky out today if you'd \nlike. Also not sure about how your diet is going but if there are any requests for this coming week \nplease let me know and I'll get started on them now. Stews, pies, steaks? \nVery sony about not communicating \nFrancis"

Normal procedure is we plug the \nnumbers into DP's calculator, price customer is willing to spend, distance from projector to the screen and the size of the \nlift or area where the projector will live and it gives us the model that will work. If DP models don't work then we move \nEFTA00647146\ndown the list JVC, Sharp, Epson, NEC and so on until we find something that fits into the parameters needed. Any and all \nequipment we recommend and are dealers of have been thoroughly tested and vetted for performance and quality. Our \nclients come first and we would never recommend anything, whether it's a projector or a DVD player, that we don't \nstand behind 100%. \nThe Sony model that's currently there is a 3000:1 contrast ratio with a lumens of 1600. The JVC we are recommending is \n120,000:1 contrast ratio and a lumens of 1200, this is the highest contrast ratio in the industry. It is full 1080p HD and is \ncapable of up to 4x HD, the lens is a built in motorized lens that allows zoom and focus for different screen sizes and can \nachieve Cinemascope without the need of a anamorphic lens. There will be no issue with the lens as we had with the DP \nand from my conversations with Richard who told me about searching the country for the last lens available for the Sony \na few years back. This projector is also 3D ready. \nI feel totally comfortable recommending this projector especially with it working within the confines of the price \nspecified by the principal.

These 2 models are geared more for commercial applications in large rooms such as \nshowrooms and corporate presentations where ambient light cannot be controlled, and that is usually the case with \nhigh lumens devices. These units will be fairly loud due to the fact that the fan will have to work hard to cool off the \nlamp, baffling can be installed to quiet them down a bit. I can't stress enough that lumens should not be the deciding \nfactor in choosing a projector for Jeff's media room, you'll probably get a sun tan and need sunglasses while watching \neither one of these models. \nAgain if Jeff wants an image that is close to 35mm film in sharpness and detail the JVC is the way to go at his price point. \nAs I stated earlier the JVC is compared to the newer version of Jeff's current Sony (that is broken), the new Sony VPL-\nVW1000ES is priced at about $25000. \nDigital Projections E Vision \nLumens 8000 \nContrast ratio 2400:1 \n$18891 \n10/Default.aspx\nOptoma TH 7500 \nEFTA00647142\nLumens 6000 \nContrast ratio 2000:1 \n$11000 \nJeff 5ternhell \nVice President \nCutting Ed e S stems \nFrom: Richard Kahn [Sent: Thursday, July 26, 2012 10:41 AM \nTo: Jeff Sternhell \nCc: \nSubject: Re: projector \nany updates on new recommendations? \nthank you \nPLEASE NOTE EFFECTIVE JUNE 5TH MY CONTACT INFO WILL BE AS FOLLOWS: \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor, \nNew York, New York 10022 \ntel \nth) \nce"

If OP models don't work then \nwe move down the list JVC, Sharp, Epson, NEC and so on until we find something that \nEFTA_R1_00283459 \nEFTA01875046\nfits into the parameters needed.

It is full 1080p HD and is capable of up to 4x \nHD, the lens is a built in motorized lens that allows zoom and focus for different screen \nsizes and can achieve Cinemascope without the need of a anamorphic lens. There will be \nno issue with the lens as we had with the DP and from my conversations with Richard \nwho told me about searching the country for the last lens available for the Sony a few \nyears back. This projector is also 3D ready. \nI feel totally comfortable recommending this projector especially with it working within \nthe confines of the price specified by the principal.

          "body": "Hi Richard, \nThe 2 projectors that we would recommend with higher lumens are Digital Projections E \nVision and Optoma TH 7500, I will go into specs below. These 2 models are geared more \nfor commercial applications in large rooms such as showrooms and corporate \npresentations where ambient light cannot be controlled, and that is usually the case \nwith high lumens devices. These units will be fairly loud due to the fact that the fan will \nhave to work hard to cool off the lamp, baffling can be installed to quiet them down a \nbit. I can't stress enough that lumens should not be the deciding factor in choosing a \nprojector for Jeffs media room, you'll probably get a sun tan and need sunglasses while \nwatching either one of these models. \nAgain if Jeff wants an image that is close to 35mm film in sharpness and detail the JVC is \nthe way to go at his price point. As I stated earlier the JVC is compared to the newer \nversion of Jeff's current Sony (that is broken), the new Sony VPL-VW1000ES is priced at \nabout $25000. \nDigital Projections E Vision \nLumens 8000 \nContrast ratio 2400:1 \n$18891 \nImp: .1www.digitalprojcction.com/BrowseProjectorsiScriesList/Projectorl.ist tabid.

One thing missing is how the phones here should be answered... If there is a standard verbiage \nyou can give me, I will fill it in. \n2) I spoke to my plate rep today, Karen Harris. We will need to purchase plates soon, as you know... I can get \ncatalogues for you to look at as well as set up an appointment to go look at the showroom if like. Going \nthrough Karen will give us a larger selection, better price and a much higher quality(stronger and lighter) than \nCrate And Barrel or other places like that. \n3) I will need to order uniforms. just like to get your approval on them before making the purchase because \nthis is something i will be wearing everyday in the house and serving the guests in. Attached are pictures of the \ncoats, pants, and aprons. I've always worn the blue(french laundry style) aprons because white is so difficult to \nkeep white, but they do come in white if you prefer. the jackets are mostly short sleeve because we are \napproaching summer. \n4) Rich is working on accounts for Costco and butcher today \n5) We placed orders for some gear for the kitchens today. Pasta machine to make fresh pastas, dehydrator for \ndried fruits and house made jerkys, etc... \n6) I Planned on taking off this weekend and back to work on Monday. I feel like I still have a good amount of \nthings to get done here in NY for JEs arrival on Saturday so I would like to spend next week training and \ncooking. A few things I am working; \nFlax Seed Granola- a few different versions that I can tweak and alter to JEs taste. Granola is something you \ncan easily buy but can be wonderful if made in house... \nEFTA00543421\nJE is interested in beef and turkey jerkeys- I know one company out of Brooklyn that does a great grass-fed \nproduct, its like high end jerky, great stuff. I plan on having that here when he arrives as well as some i will be \nmaking. Again we can purchase it, but to make our own is much nicer because we can make it taste however \nhe would like. Smokey or sweet or even have some asian notes to it... \nSorbets and ice creams \nChicken and veggie stocks and sauces- the store bought broths are packed with MSG and made from who \nknows what... \nI have a bunch of new books on California cuisine and small bites • going through and working on new \nsnacks \nI will touch base with the butcher on Monday and get some veal to test, hopefully i can get something worth \ncooking finally. \n7) Last but not least AUSTRALIAN WINTER TRUFFLES are coming to the country on the 27th!! We will \nneed to order some as soon as thy arrive. \nThank you \nFrancis"

I do believe that a white board and projector for mac \nand pc are needed. basic drinks, snacks... \nI have no information on how people will arrive, what is happening \nto the spouses/partners. Can't just \"dump them,\" so some things \nwould be nice to be set up. What sort of other relaxing activities will \nbe there. What happens when people arrive, that night, etc. \nWe wanted to arrange for one of the people to do a gourmet bbq and \ntalk about the science of cooking on one of the nights at Jeff's \nisland... (but that would have to be arranged) \nEFTA00900584\nneed to know about meals (both for the attendees as well as their \nguests). When they can join and when they can not. \nIf you want to call to discuss, I would be happy to arrange a time. \nPerhaps, we can work somethings out on the above, and then, Jeff \ndoesn't have to think about it? \nAppreciative of your understanding in the above. \nYours, \nAl \nFrom: Cecile de Jongh ‹ > \nTo: Al Seckel e.[ > \nSent: Tue, December 21, 2010 9:58:06 AM \nSubject: Fw: MINDSHIFT \nAl, \nIf you have no preference on room set up, do you want me to just arrange that?

He'll star opposite Eva Green and Susan Sarandon. \nWriter-director Nicholas Jarecki is set to start principal photography in Gotham next spring. \nMichael Ohoven (\"Capote\") is producing and financing through his Infinity Media banner. Kevin Turen and Robert Salerno also are \nproducers. \nLisa Wilson's Parlay Films, an affiliate of GK Films, is selling international rights and will debut the project at the American Film \nMarket. ICM is repping North American rights. \nLaura Bickford (\"Traffic\") and Brian Young (\"The Runaways\") are exec producing the pic. \n\"Arbitrage\" stars Pacino as a hedge fund magnate who is in over his head and desperate to complete the sale of his trading empire \nto a major bank before his fraud is revealed. But an unexpected, bloody error forces him to turn to the most unlikely corner for \nhelp. \nForeign buyers have shown keen interest in financial dramas in the wake of the economic collapse of late 2008. Myriad Pictures has \nseen brisk sales for Kevin Spacey-Jeremy Irons-Zachary Quinto topliner \"Margin Call,\" which will also be at AFM. \nOther upcoming Pacino projects include Sony's Adam Sandler comedy \"Jack and Jill,\" which is eyeing a November start date. He's \nalso circling a \"King Lear\" project. He was last in theaters in 2008 in \"Righteous Kill.\" \nSarandon was most recently seen in 20th Century Fox's \"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.\" \nGreen (\"Casino Royale,\" \"The Golden Compass\") is in production on the \"Camelot\" series for Starz and GK-TV. \nEFTA00752152\nJarecki's credits include docu \"The Outsider\" featuring James Toback. He also co-wrote \"The Informers\" with Bret Easton Ellis. He's \nthe brother of filmmakers Andrew and Eugene Jarecki. \nOhoven is in post-production on \"The Fields,\" starring Sam Worthington. \nInfinity will next produce and finance psychological thriller \"The Door,\" which begins lensing later this month. \nContact Pamela McClintock ai \nNicholas Jarecki \nThe Green Room \n--- End of Forwarded Message \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

I \nhave also included the plan as an excel file so you can tweak it to your liking;) The numbers aren't perfect but they are within \nstriking distance and I've done a lot of work to vet them and get them here, considering every possible cost and revenue source. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned my current equity investor (Michael Ohoven) announced to me yesterday that he will not take any \npartners and will only shoot the film for 10MM all-in (including finance) in Louisiana with 26 shooting days, 3 of them in New York, \nwith me not having much say on anything. He is asking me to sign over all rights now. He has some special deal in Lousiana that I \ndon't even want to know about and I think that's his big motivation. \nOf course, I have no idea whether Al or the rest of the cast would go to Lousiana and if Lisa Wilson my sales agent would be able to \npreserve her sales figures if we shot there. I feel creatively the film should be shot in NYC, especially as I have all my free toys there I \ncan provide to enhance its feeling. \nI'm open to any arrangement that works for you. I have the passion to see this movie through and make it with heart and beauty in \nNew York, in the incredible locations I can provide for free, with the great cast that has come to play. Lost week the hip-hop \nsensation \"Drake\" signed on to playJimmy! He's a wonderful guy and will do great work (and work hard to promote the movie and \nsubstantially raise our American media and viewing profile.) \nKevin Turen (my creative producer and partner from the film's genesis) and I have committed to put up 500k in equity each. He and \nI have also deferred all of our producing fees, and I have deferred my writing and directing fee entirely. \nIn the last week I have faced the inevitable; I have begun cutting the script with my teacher, and we have artfully rewritten pages \n(we're not there yet, but we'll get to 105 pages) and the budget down to an achievable 9.5MM for a 29 day shoot in NYC that would \nstart March 21st. \nThe attached plan assumes we can get a bank loan after fees and discounts of about 6MM. I don't have term sheets, but I have \nkicked the tires on these numbers pretty well and believe they will hold up. I'm trying to get term sheets now (but with holidays it is \ntough this week). My excellent line producer Bob Salerno (\"A Single Man,\" \"21 Grams\") is already in process with a company called \nTCF on tax credit finance bids for New York. \nWe will need about 3.8MM in equity to finance the remainder of the film. As Kevin and I will put up 1MM together, we need an \nadditional 2.8MM in equity. \nI believe we will recoup and go into profit based on this plan, as it only assumes a 1.1MM US sale and there are about 2.8MM \nworth of unloaned foreign sales and tax credits to collect upon, assuming no overages in foreign sales. You asked how we could \nmake money: we could get it by doing better on foreign sales (as they will certainly increase from showing and selling completed \nfootage to buyers if I deliver a quality film— right now they have only bought a piece of paper- so when I show footage if it is good \nthey will pay more— of course you have to believe I will make a good movie!) We could also make money through a higher US sale. \nSales recently have been as high as 5mm and some decent films (like Rabbit Hole with Nicole Kidman) have gone for 3mm- we're \nonly projecting 1.1mm. Finally one could force it straight to DVD, and I believe with this cast collect at least 2mm just from that, and \nalready be 1mm in profit. I believe the downside risk of the equity is 1mm (we'd have to really mess up to have 0 domestic sale or \ndrastically reduced remaining foreign)- and the upside is probably 2mm at least (lm increase on foreign, and lm increase on \ndomestic). Another way to go would be to self-distribute domestically, and put up our own P&A (although this is tricky and will \nrequire a couple million more spend- but could result in 5mm upside— and it's a decision that can be made down the line). \nIf you thought any of this plan made sense, we would be ready to go, and the moves would be: to sign off (we can execute contracts \nvery quickly), fund some prep (200k of work to start scouting and working on the movie in mid-December in NYC), and make Al pay \nor play for our March 21st shoot (his agent Jeff Berg is screaming for his 1.8mm money guarnatee now!) in order to keep our dates \nand our principal actor. \nWe would shoot March 21 in NYC for about 30 days over 6 weeks. We'd then edit and post the film in New York over a 3 month \nperiod. We'd probably be ready to deliver it around March 2012. \nOne additional option would be also take out the bank position, which would save at least 714k in fees and a lot of headache. But it \nrequires a lot more commitment (an additional 6mm)- so we can table that and know it will work without it. \nIf you came in you could executive produce or produce the film, and come on set, go to all premieres, receive awards, all the nice \nfun stuff. \nFinally our foreign sales agent Lisa is currently at deal 7.5% upfront fees of her sales (7.5% deferred) plus 150k market fee in these \nprojections. I believe if we were serious we could ask her to defer a bit more, but who knows. \nEFTA00752151\nI thank you very much for looking at all this. As my current partner has put a gun to my head, I do need to give him a yes by next \nTuesday, or risk no movie at all. Of course, I'd love to tell him goodbye. \nHave a great Thanksgiving, and no matter the answer- I appreciate you looking at this all. I expect nothing. \nGive my dad a hug for me. \nBest, \nNick \nPS please note attached budget is 10.65mm- but we have down to 9.5-10mm- still working with my guy to redo the numbers but \nthey are really there- just don't have document finished yet- and numbers are real. \nPPS This may be in \"movie shorthand\" so I can walk through in detail anything that doesn't just make sense. I also have all the real \npeople to talk to available at a moment's notice."

My excellent line producer Bob Salerno (\"A Single Man,\" \"21 Grams\") is already in process with a company called \nTCF on tax credit finance bids for New York. \nWe will need about 3.8MM in equity to finance the remainder of the film.

You asked how we could \nmake money: we could get it by doing better on foreign sales (as they will certainly increase from showing and selling completed \nfootage to buyers if I deliver a quality film— right now they have only bought a piece of paper- so when I show footage if it is good \nthey will pay more— of course you have to believe I will make a good movie!) We could also make money through a higher US sale. \nSales recently have been as high as 5mm and some decent films (like Rabbit Hole with Nicole Kidman) have gone for 3mm- we're \nonly projecting 1.1mm. Finally one could force it straight to DVD, and I believe with this cast collect at least 2mm just from that, and \nalready be 1mm in profit. I believe the downside risk of the equity is 1mm (we'd have to really mess up to have 0 domestic sale or \ndrastically reduced remaining foreign)- and the upside is probably 2mm at least (lm increase on foreign, and lm increase on \ndomestic). Another way to go would be to self-distribute domestically, and put up our own P&A (although this is tricky and will \nrequire a couple million more spend- but could result in 5mm upside— and it's a decision that can be made down the line). \nIf you thought any of this plan made sense, we would be ready to go, and the moves would be: to sign off (we can execute contracts \nvery quickly), fund some prep (200k of work to start scouting and working on the movie in mid-December in NYC), and make Al pay \nor play for our March 21st shoot (his agent Jeff Berg is screaming for his 1.8mm money guarnatee now!) in order to keep our dates \nand our principal actor. \nWe would shoot March 21 in NYC for about 30 days over 6 weeks.

If the script is remarkable, and his \nexecution is great, the upside is that it does well at festival circuit and sells for a top price. \nObviously I know your longstanding important relationship with The Jarecki's , so let me know how I can be \nhelpful to you. \nBest, \nBarry J \nFrom: Jeff Epstein leevacationagmail.com>\nDate: Thu, 25 Nov 2010 05:56:50 -0800 \nTo: Barry Josephson \nSubject: Fwd: FW: \"Arbitrage\" \n Forwarded message \nFrom: Nicholas Jarecki \nDate: Thu, Nov 25, 2010 at 12:56 AM \nSubject: FW: \"Arbitrage\" \n\nCONFIDENTIAL \nHi Jeffrey, \nThanks for your call today; I hope I was amusing even under my current circumstances! \nPer our talk, enclosed please find a finance plan for Arbitrage, as well as my updated sales figures (now up to 4.4 million sold.) I have \nalso included the plan as an excel file so you can tweak it to your liking;) The numbers aren't perfect but they are within striking \ndistance and I've done a lot of work to vet them and get them here, considering every possible cost and revenue source. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned my current equity investor (Michael Ohoven) announced to me yesterday that he will not take any \npartners and will only shoot the film for 10MM all-In (including finance) in Louisiana with 26 shooting days, 3 of them in New York, \nwith me not having much say on anything. He is asking me to sign over all rights now. He has some special deal in Lousiana that I don't \neven want to know about and I think that's his big motivation. \nOf course, I have no idea whether Al or the rest of the cast would go to Lousiana and if Lisa Wilson my sales agent would be able to \npreserve her sales figures if we shot there. I feel creatively the film should be shot in NYC, especially as I have all my free toys there I \ncan provide to enhance its feeling. \nEFTA00752154\nI'm open to any arrangement that works for you. I have the passion to see this movie through and make it with heart and beauty in \nNew York, in the incredible locations I can provide for free, with the great cast that has come to play. Lost week the hip-hop sensation \n\"Drake\" signed on to play Jimmy! He's a wonderful guy and will do great work (and work hard to promote the movie and substantially \nraise our American media and viewing profile.) \nKevin Turen (my creative producer and partner from the film's genesis) and I have committed to put up 500k in equity each. He and I \nhave also deferred all of our producing fees, and I have deferred my writing and directing fee entirely. \nIn the last week I have faced the inevitable; I have begun cutting the script with my teacher, and we have artfully rewritten pages \n(we're not there yet, but we'll get to 105 pages) and the budget down to an achievable 9.5MM for a 29 day shoot in NYC that would \nstart March 21st. \nThe attached plan assumes we can get a bank loan after fees and discounts of about 6MM. I don't have term sheets, but I have kicked \nthe tires on these numbers pretty well and believe they will hold up. I'm trying to get term sheets now (but with holidays it is tough \nthis week). My excellent line producer Bob Salerno (\"A Single Man,\" \"21 Grams\") is already in process with a company called TCF on \ntax credit finance bids for New York. \nWe will need about 3.8MM in equity to finance the remainder of the film. As Kevin and I will put up 1MM together, we need an \nadditional 2.8MM in equity. \nI believe we will recoup and go into profit based on this plan, as it only assumes a 1.1MM US sale and there are about 2.8MM worth \nof unloaned foreign sales and tax credits to collect upon, assuming no overages in foreign sales. You asked how we could make money: \nwe could get it by doing better on foreign sales (as they will certainly increase from showing and selling completed footage to buyers if \nI deliver a quality film— right now they have only bought a piece of paper- so when I show footage if it is good they will pay more— of \ncourse you have to believe I will make a good movie!) We could also make money through a higher US sale. Sales recently have been \nas high as 5mm and some decent films (like Rabbit Hole with Nicole Kidman) have gone for 3mm- we're only projecting 1.1mm. Finally \none could force it straight to DVD, and I believe with this cast collect at least 2mm just from that, and already be 1mm in profit. I \nbelieve the downside risk of the equity is 1mm (we'd have to really mess up to have 0 domestic sale or drastically reduced remaining \nforeign)- and the upside is probably 2mm at least (lm increase on foreign, and lm increase on domestic). Another way to go would be \nto self-distribute domestically, and put up our own P&A (although this is tricky and will require a couple million more spend- but could \nresult in Smm upside— and it's a decision that can be made down the line). \nIf you thought any of this plan made sense, we would be ready to go, and the moves would be: to sign off (we can execute contracts \nvery quickly), fund some prep (200k of work to start scouting and working on the movie in mid-December in NYC), and make Al pay or \nplay for our March 21st shoot (his agent Jeff Berg is screaming for his 1.8mm money guarnatee now!) in order to keep our dates and \nour principal actor. \nWe would shoot March 21 in NYC for about 30 days over 6 weeks. We'd then edit and post the film in New York over a 3 month \nperiod. We'd probably be ready to deliver it around March 2012. \nOne additional option would be also take out the bank position, which would save at least 714k in fees and a lot of headache. But it \nrequires a lot more commitment (an additional 6mm)- so we can table that and know it will work without it. \nIf you came in you could executive produce or produce the film, and come on set, go to all premieres, receive awards, all the nice fun \nstuff. \nFinally our foreign sales agent Lisa is currently at deal 7.5% upfront fees of her sales (7.5% deferred) plus 150k market fee in these \nprojections. I believe if we were serious we could ask her to defer a bit more, but who knows. \nI thank you very much for looking at all this. As my current partner has put a gun to my head, I do need to give him a yes by next \nTuesday, or risk no movie at all. Of course, I'd love to tell him goodbye. \nHave a great Thanksgiving, and no matter the answer- I appreciate you looking at this all. I expect nothing. \nGive my dad a hug for me. \nBest, \nNick \nPS please note attached budget is 10.6Smm- but we have down to 9.S-l0mm- still working with my guy to redo the numbers but they \nEFTA00752155\nare really there- just don't have document finished yet- and numbers are real. \nPPS This may be in \"movie shorthand\" so I can walk through in detail anything that doesn't just make sense. I also have all the real \npeople to talk to available at a moment's notice."

In time, of course, it will be constructed with other scientists too, both ones \nyou know and ones that you don't know, and should, and in your own voice. \nThe purpose of this is for the search engines, which means, I made it deliberately long, I broke up \nyour questions repeatedly, and repeated your name over and over in a way that wasn't obvious for \nwhat we were trying to accomplish. The fastest first path is the one we are taking. I used my \ninterview first, because I could control it, and I could write it easily, and it had real content, not \npseudo-content, and get it up by today. \nJust fyi, it took me several hours to get Murray to give me only two sentences that I could use. \nOther interviews will be going up, but they are in process of being made. I have asked for \nmaterials from your side, but I can't use just names and generalities if you want this to be effective. \nOk, so, I know most of the people and their work that you are referring to, but I have to build the \ncontent for them, and as these are serious people, it needs to be done correctly.

You give me the remaining stuff for \nscience, I'll generate content for sports. We also need asap at least two articles (400+ words) \non Jeffrey Epstein and Science from you. (I'll take care of the sports) Philippines are continuing to \ndo a lot of backend work, with additional work as soon as they receive the articles and photos from \nJeff. The sooner this happens, the more likely we have a shot of getting ranked by end of the \nmonth. This activity will be ongoing through the end of the month. Sports blog will continue after \nthat. Science blog should also continue after that as well. \nOnce additional money comes in I can continue to start pimping the \"other\" Jeffrey Epsteins that \nalready exist on the web, trying to jump them up in rankings. We will also be working simultaneously \nto get other Jeffrey Epstein photos to appear in Google Search results \nWe are also working on the JeffreyEpstein.org which will be the charity site. I need similar extensive \nand specific content on his charitable work. Also, we will do a mobile version of the science site so \nthat we can dominate mobile searches. \nThen i will \nbuild jeffreyepsteinforbes.com jeffreyepsteinvanityfair.com jeffreyepsteindeposition.com jeffreyepste \nindailybeast.com sites which will give a positive spin on these news articles (NOTE: These are \nsearch terms that come up via google instant or google suggest so they must be addressed) \nWe are continuing trying to tweak the Wikipedia process. He has over twenty people with google \nalerts on him, who go and undo our edits every time we remove material. We will have to take some \nmore extreme measures, but this will be easier with links once the other sites are up and functional. \nWe also need tol create another Jeffrey Epstein site (with videos) which should help alleviate some \nof the video search results. \nAs you know there will be lots of work on the backend to generate links to ensure the sites we are \npromoting (both our own Jeffrey Epstein and \"other\" Jeffrey Epstein websites) so they end up on the \nfirst page of Google. \nThe key is to do things strategically, with regularity, and not always all at once.
