We want to ask and answer \nquestions like \"How much can we understand about the universe, \nsoon?\" \"What is the role of theory and of experiment in getting \nEFTA_R1_00195514 \nEFTA01822115\nthere?\" \"Are there things we may not understand?\" and \"How much \nof what we think we know might be wrong?\". The meeting fosters \ndiscussion and we are convinced that when the best people talk the \noutcome is advance and growth. We are hoping we can avoid standard \nprepared talks, and focus on exciting forefront issues, where \nthere may be differences of opinion, or new results that will \nprovoke wide discussion. You will receive more information about \nthe program and your own possible role in the near future. The \nsummit is inspired by the onset of the Large Hadron Collider, the \nPlanck mission, the recent results by satellite and ground based \nexperiments on dark matter searches, and the vast progress in \ntheory. Also by meetings such as the LHC Olympics, and the \nworkshops of the past years at the MCTP, KITP and Perimeter as \nwell as interdisciplinary gatherings of the ASU Origins, the Edge \nMaster-Classes and Google's SciFoo. \nVenues/Highlights: \n1. The first day of the summit will be held at the \nheadquarters of SpaceX . The end of the \nday will be marked by Elon Musk giving a tour of his \"Falcon\" and \n\"Dragon\" construction and missions. A Tesla surprise will be built \ninto the tour. \n2. The second day will be held at Caltech's Cahill Center \n for \nAstronomy and Astrophysics. \n3. Participants will be housed at the The Andaz West Hollywood \n Hyatt \nHotel where the kick-off reception and dinner will be given, \nsponsored by Nick Pritzker. \n4. The closing of the meeting will be a premiere of a short \nfilm by Jesse Dylan on \nthe LHC. \n5. The summit is by invitation only; There is no registration \nor other fees; Just make your way to LA and the rest is covered \n(limited air travel support will be available for younger \nparticipants). \nInvited Participants include: Steven Weinberg, Mathew Buckley, \nFrank Wilczek, Neil \nWeiner, Savas Dimopoulos, Liantao Wang, Cumrun Vafa, \nDan Chung, Nima Arkani-Hamed, Aaron Pierce, Lisa \nRandall, David Gross, Gordy Kane, Joe Lykken, Kip \nThorne, Chiara Nappi, Edward Witten, Gia Dvali, John \nSchwarz, Nati Seiberg, Mike Turner, Rocky \nKolb, David Politzer, Lawrence Krauss, Steve Myers, \nEFTA_R1_00195515 \nEFTA01822116\nBarry Barish, Hiroshi Ooguri, Marc Kamionkowski , Stephen \nHawking, Mark Wise, Andrew Lange, Roger Blanford, Sunil Golwala, \nSean Carroll, John PresIcill, Fabiola Gianotti, Laura Baudis, \nDavid Saltzberg, Asimina Arvanitaki, Kathryn Zurek, Mirko Boezio, \nand others (to be ordered alphabetically). \nFriday January 8, 6 pm \nCocktail Reception/Dinner \nAndaz Hotel \nSaturday January 9 \n7:30/8:30 \nGroup breakfast at private dinning room \nAndaz Hotel \n8:30/9:15 \nBuses to SpaceX \nSpaceX \n9:30/10:00 \n\"Dueling Big Pictures: Duel I\" \n10:10/10:40 \n\"Duel\" 2 \n10:50/11:20 \n\"Duel\" 3 \n11:30/12:00 \n\"Duel\" 4 \n12:15 /14:00 \nLunch \n14:00/15:00 \nPanel/Round Table Discussion on \"Duels\" \nEFTA_R1_00195516 \nEFTA01822117\n15:00/15:30 \nCoffee Break \n15:30/17:30 \n10 minutes contributions from participants [10 slides max- 6 \npresentations + discussion] \n17:45/18:40 \nSpaceX tour \nElon Musk \n18:40/19:30 \nBuses to Andaz Hotel \n20:00/22:00 \nDinner Party \nAndaz Hotel \nSunday January 10 \n7:30/8:30 \nGroup breakfast at private dinning room \nAndaz Hotel \n8:30/9:15 \nBuses to Cahill/Caltech \n9:30 /11:00 \n3 deconstruction talks: What we think we really know, but maybe \nwe don't? \nCahill auditorium/Caltech \n10:30/11:00 \nCoffee Break \nCahill Center library and patios \nEFTA_R1_00195517 \nEFTA01822118\n11:00/12:00 \nPanel/Round Table Discussion on deconstruction talks \n12:00/13:00 \nFeature of \"Firsts and Recents\" : first LHC collisions data/ \nfirst Planck data/recent CDMS opened box/other \n13:00/14:00 \nLunch \nCahill Center library and patios \n14:30/16:30 \nCahill auditorium \n16:30/17:00 \nCoffee break \n17:00/18:30 \n3 closing summaries 30 mins each \nsynthesis/antithesis/diagnosis/prognosis \n_19:00 -20:00 Premiere of Jesse Dylan's LHC movie (10mins) & \nClosing Cocktail Reception_ \nGordy Kane, Joe Lykken and Maria Spiropulu with Andrew Lange, Mark \nWise, Marc Kamionkowski, Sunil Golwala and with advice \nfrom _Steven Weinberg_, _Nima_ Arkani-Hamed_ and _Savas_ Dimopoulos_ \n*********************************************************** \nEFTA_R1_00195518 \nEFTA01822119\nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

I do believe that a white \nboard and projector for mac and pc are needed. basic \ndrinks, snacks... \nI have no information on how people will arrive, what is happening to \nthe spouses/partners. Can't just \"dump them,\" so some \nthings would be nice to be set up. What sort of other \nrelaxing activities will be there. What happens when people \narrive, that night, etc. \nWe wanted to arrange for one of the people to do a gourmet bbq and \ntalk about the science of cooking on one of the nights at \nJeffs island... (but that would have to be arranged) \nneed to know about meals (both for the attendees as well as their \nguests). When they can join and when they can not. \nIf you want to call to discuss, I would be happy to arrange a time. \nPerhaps, we can work somethings out on the above, and \nthen, Jeff doesn't have to think about it? \nAppreciative of your understanding in the above. \nEFTA R1_00497765 \nEFTA02001055\nYours, \nAl \nFrom: Cecile de Jongh <ceciledeionuh@vahoo.com>\nTo: Al Seckel \nSent: Tue, December 21, 2010 9:58:06 AM \nSubject: Fw: MINDSHIFT \nAl, \nIf you have no preference on room set up, do you want me to just \narrange that?

O'Toole Jr., 'did not meet the standard' of \nfairness, because he did not sufficiently scrutinize sitting jurors for bias.\" In arguments during \nEFTA01658027\nDecember, attorneys for Tsarnaev \"had pointed to 22 Twitter posts and retweets by the jury's \nforewoman - one referring to Mr. Tsarnaev as `that piece of garbage' - that had not been \nvoluntarily disclosed as part of jury screening.\" \nThe Washington Post (7/31, Sacchetti, 14.2M) reports the case is going to return \"to the \nlower court for additional hearings, but the court's overturning of the death sentences does not \nmean Tsarnaev will have an opportunity to get out of prison.\" The court said, \"Dzhokhar will \nremain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being \nwhether the government will end his life by executing him.\" The Post adds, \"Tsarnaev's federal \ndefenders said in a statement Friday that they were `grateful for the Court's straightforward and \nfair decision.\" \nThe AP (7/31, Richer) reports, \"A three -judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals ordered a new penalty -phase trial on whether the 27-year -old Tsarnaev should be \nexecuted for the attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. `But make \nno mistake: Dzhokhar will spend his remaining days locked up in prison, with the only matter \nremaining being whether he will die by execution,' Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote in the \nruling, more than six months after arguments were heard in the case.\" Prosecutors \"could ask \nthe full appeals court to hear the case or go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" \nUSA Today (7/31, Garrison, 10.31M) reports, \"Prior to his sentencing, attorneys for \nTsarnaev, 19 at the time of the bombings, agreed their client was responsible for the deaths but \ncontended he was less culpable than his accomplice, older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was \nkilled by authorities following a four-day manhunt. A fourth victim, an MIT police officer, was \nshot and killed by the Tsarnaev brothers during the manhunt. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense \nattorneys argued during a December appeal hearing he did not receive a fair trial in Boston \nbefore he was sentenced to death, pointing to relentless media coverage in the city where the \nbombing occurred and city-wide trauma that `filtered' into the jury pool. They said two jurors \nlied by concealing prejudiced remarks made on social media about the case before the trial.\" \nReuters (7/31, Raymond) reports that Judge Thompson \"said the trial judge `fell short' in \nconducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial \npublicity surrounding the high-profile case. Thompson said the pervasive news coverage of the \nbombings and their aftermath featured `bone-chilling' photos and videos of Tsarnaev, now 27, \nand his brother carrying backpacks at the marathon and of those injured and killed near its \nfinish line. Thompson said the judge deemed jurors eligible who had `already formed an opinion \nthat Dzhokhar was guilty - and he did so in large part because they answered \"yes\" to the \nquestion whether they could decide this high-profile case based on the evidence.\" \nThe Hill (7/31, Moreno, 2.98M) reports, \"Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued that his \nsentencing trial should not be held in Boston, where jurors have been exposed to heavy local \nand national media coverage of the attack and its aftermath.\" \nThe AP (8/1, Mustian, Ring) reports, \"'Boston Strong' remains a `vibrant' rallying cry more \nthan seven years after the marathon bombing killed three people and injured more than 260 \nothers, a federal appeals court noted as it threw out the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,\" \nbut \"even as the ruling opened old wounds, it raised familiar questions about whether Tsarnaev \ncan receive a fair hearing in the city where the bombs exploded — a community that may now \nbe asked to relive unspeakable trauma.\" The AP adds, \"The Justice Department is expected to \nappeal. Legal observers predict prosecutors will turn straight to the U.S. Supreme Court without \nasking for a hearing before the full 1st Circuit. The U.S. government recently resumed federal \nexecutions following a 17-year pause and, under President Donald Trump, has pursued capital \npunishment in an increasing number of cases.\" The Hill (8/2, Klar, 2.98M), the Springfield (MA). \nRepublican (8/2, Croteau, 395K), and the Boston Globe (8/1, Crimaldi, 972K) also report. \nThe Wall Street Journal (7/31, Kamp, Randazzo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) as well \nas brief CBS Evening NewsVi (7/31, story 12, 0:19, O'Donnell, 3.97M) and NBC Nightly NewsVi \n(7/31, story 11, 0:20, Holt, 5.44M) broadcasts provided similar coverage. \nEFTA01658028\nTrump Demands Death Penalty For Tsarnaev. The New York Post (8/2, Sheehy, \n4.57M) reports that in a tweet Sunday afternoon, President Trump \"demanded the death \npenalty for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - whose execution was taken off the \ntable by an appellate court last week.\" Trump wrote, \"Rarely has anybody deserved the death \npenalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The court agreed that this \"was one \nof the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities\". Yet the appellate court tossed \nout the death sentence. So many lives lost and ruined. The Federal Government must again \nseek the Death Penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial. Our Country cannot let \nthe appellate decision stand. Also, it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long!\" \nReuters (8/2, Schroeder) reports, \"In a tweet, Trump said the federal government must \nchallenge a Friday appeals court decision overturning the death penalty for the 2013 attack. \n`Rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar \nTsarnaev,' tweeted Trump. `The Federal Government must again seek the Death Penalty in a do-\nover of that chapter of the original trial.\" \nPROTESTS \nPortland Protests Calmer After Federal Agents Stand Down. \nThe Washington Post (8/2, Taylor, Rosenberg, 14.2M) reports that after \"66 straight nights,\" the \nprotests in downtown Portland \"may be reaching a turning point: The weekend brought none of \nthe large-scale tear gas and firework -fueled clashes that marked the previous two months of \nunrest, a potential sign of calming tensions after the Trump administration pulled back federal \nlaw enforcement officers.\" However, it is \"not clear what direction the protests in the city, which \nshow no sign of stopping, will take next.\" \nIn a similar report headlined \"With No Federal Agents On Streets, Portland Protests Turn \nLargely Peaceful,\" the Wall Street Journal (8/2, Caldwell, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says \nthat since Thursday, the first night without a visible federal law enforcement presence, protests \nhave been mostly peaceful. The New York Times (8/2, Baker, 18.61M) too reports that on \nSaturday night, \"the crowd saw a third consecutive night of calm since the start of a plan to \nwithdraw federal agents who had brought a militarized crackdown to the city.\" \nThe AP (7/31, Flaccus) reports that in Portland, there has been a \"dramatic change in tone \noutside a federal courthouse that's become ground zero in clashes between demonstrators and \nfederal agents...after the U.S. government began drawing down its forces under a deal between \nDemocratic Gov. Kate Brown and the Trump administration.\" According to the AP, \"As agents \nfrom U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement pulled back, troopers with the Oregon State Police were supposed to take \nover.\" The AP says \"there were no signs of any law enforcement presence outside the Mark O. \nHatfield Federal Courthouse, however, where a protest lasted into early Friday.\" \nThe Washington Post (7/31, Taylor, 14.2M) also reports that \"as the Black Lives Matter-\ninspired vigil wound down early Friday morning, there was virtually no sign of the Oregon State \nPolice officers who had taken over protection of the federal buildings at the center of the \nprotests.\" According to the Post, \"Instead of being forcibly removed from downtown's Lownsdale \nSquare and the adjacent Chapman Square...the crowd thinned out on its own, with many \nprotesters heading home of their own accord.\" The Post says that \"by a little after 1 a.m., only a \nrelatively small crew remained, far down from the enormous crowd that had gathered four \nhours earlier to listen to speakers and chant anti -law enforcement slogans.\" \nReuters (7/31, Bloom) reports that Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell \"tweeted his thanks \nto protesters who stopped attempts to light fires and throw projectiles on the 63rd night of \ndemonstrations, when there were no arrests.\" While Reuters adds that acting Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Wolf indicated Friday morning that DHS agents \"remained on standby and \nNational Guard troops could be sent in should state police be overrun,\" the Wall Street Journal \nEFTA01658029\n(7/31, Caldwell, Calfas, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says that officials in Portland expect \nthe protests this weekend will be less violent given the drawdown of federal forces. \nTrump: DHS Will Remain In Portland Until Police \"Complete Cleanup Of \nAnarchists And Agitators.\" President Trump on Friday tweeted, \"Homeland Security is not \nleaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!\" \nWolf: Joint Federal -Local Policing Has \"Worked Fairly Well\" In Portland. \nAppearing on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/31, 831K), Wolf said the developments in Portland \n\"worked fairly well. What we saw is we saw a robust contingent of Oregon State Police come \ninto the area yesterday afternoon together with Portland Police Bureau. They cleaned out the \nparks across the street from the courthouse and what we saw overnight is almost little to no \ncriminal activity. And that really is how it should be. It reinforces the principle if you work with \nfederal state and local law enforcement work together we can protect our communities. We can \nsecure our communities. We can secure federal properties and protect law enforcement officers. \nThis is what we have been asking for or over 60 days and I'm glad Oregon and Portland has \nfinally accepted up to the challenge.\" \nCuccinelli Highlights Barr's House Testimony Regarding Portland Protests. \nSpeaking on Chicago's Morning Answer (7/31), Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary \nCuccinelli discussed Attorney General Barr's recent House testimony regarding the presence of \nfederal agents in Portland. Cuccinelli also discussed the DHS' role in protecting federal property, \nincluding the federal courthouse. \nUS Marshals Discuss Portland Protests, Role In Protecting Federal Courthouse. \nAppearing on NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/31, story 13, 1:58, Holt, 5.44M), US Marshals Service \nDirector Donald Washington and US Marshall Russel Burger discussed the protests in Portland \nand their role in protecting the federal courthouse. Washington said, \"People should be yelling, \nshouting from the courthouse steps their grievances, not trying to burn it to the ground.\" When \nasked by NBC's Erin McLaughlin, \"Who are these people that are doing this?,\" Burger \nresponded, \"We have legitimate protesters that are out there expressing their First Amendment \nright, and we support that. But then you've got this other group, they want nothing more than \nto create chaos and injure people. And it's not a big group.\" \nJudge Allows Release Of 18 -Year -Old Accused Of Attempted Arson At Portland \nCourthouse. The Oregonian (7/31, Bernstein, 1M) reports Gabriel Agard-Berryhill, 18, \"made \nhis first appearance in federal court Friday on an attempted arson allegation, accused of lighting \nand throwing a large firework Tuesday over the fence that struck and set on fire protective \nwood covering the entrance to the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse.\" The Oregonian \nadds US Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo \"allowed Agard-Berryhill to be released,\" but he \"must \nnot come within a five -block radius of the courthouse at any time of the day or night while his \ncase is pending.\" \nJudge May Order Federal Agents To Wear Numbered Jerseys. Politico (7/31, \nGerstein, 4.29M) reports US District Court Judge Michael Simon on Friday suggested the \nuniforms of federal agents \"responding to long -running protests and unrest in that city be \nemblazoned with easily visible numbers so officers can be easily identified if they commit \nabuses.\" Politico says Simon's comments came \"in connection with a lawsuit he's overseeing \nthat accuses city police and federal law enforcement officers of unjustified use of force against \njournalists and legal observers monitoring the protests, which have centered in recent weeks on \nthe main federal courthouse in Portland.\" \nPoll: 53% Support Deployment To Protect Federal Property, 475 Opposed. The \nHill (7/31, Schulte, 2.98M) reports a Hill-HarrisX poll of 948 \"registered voters\" (7/26-7/27) \nfound 53% \"said they support sending federal agents to major cities in order to protect federal \nproperty despite the mayors of those cities not making a request for such action,\" while 47% \n\"opposed the Trump administration's move.\" However, The Hill adds the survey \"fell heavily \nalong party lines with 76 percent of Republican respondents saying they agreed with the use of \nfederal troops to protect federal property while 77 percent of Democrats said they disagree with \nEFTA01658030\nthe move. Fifty-five percent of independent voters said they disagree with the move. The \nsurvey found 55 percent of white voters agree with federal agents and officers being deployed \ninto major cities to protect federal property. Twenty-one percent of Black voters said they \noppose the move along with 33 percent of Hispanic voters.\" \nDHS Official Whose Office Compiled Intelligence Regarding Journalists Gets \nReassigned. \nThe New York Times (8/1, Kanno-Youngs, Goldman, 18.61M) reports Department of Homeland \nSecurity Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Brian Murphy was reassigned \n\"after his office compiled reports about protesters and journalists covering the Trump \nadministration's response to unrest in Portland, Ore., last month.\" Murphy was moved \"to a new \nposition in [DHS) after his office disseminated to the law enforcement community 'open -source \nintelligence reports' containing Twitter posts of journalists, noting they had published leaked \nunclassified documents, according to an administration official familiar with the matter.\" The \nTimes adds, \"It was not clear what Mr. Murphy's new position would be.\" \nThe Washington Post (8/1, Harris, Miroff, 14.2M) reports the decision to remove Murphy \nfrom his job was made on Friday by Acting DHS Secretary Wolf. DHS \"has been under mounting \nscrutiny from lawmakers and civil liberties groups over its use of federal law enforcement \nofficers to quell protests in Portland and in light of President Trump's threat to deploy federal \npersonnel to other cities that he asserts are being overrun by violent criminals.\" \nDHS Stops Collecting Intel On Reporters Covering Portland Response. The New \nYork Times (7/31, Kanno-Youngs, Tracy, 18.61M) reports DHS spokesman Alexei Woltornist \n\"said on Friday that [Wolf] had shut down an intelligence examination of the work of reporters \ncovering the government's response to protests in Portland, Ore., beginning an investigation \ninto what he suggested was an infringement on First Amendment rights.\" Woltornist said, \"The \nacting secretary is committed to ensuring that all D.H.S. personnel uphold the principles of \nprofessionalism, impartiality and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it \nrelates to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\" Woltornist added Wolf ordered DHS to \n\"immediately discontinue collecting information involving members of the press\" once he \nlearned of its actions. \nMeanwhile, Reuters (7/31, Hosenball) reports all seven Democrats on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee on Friday \"wrote to the Department of Homeland Security requesting \ndetails on its agents conducting intelligence monitoring of ongoing anti -racism protests in \nPortland.\" \nCuccinelli Relaxed Oversight Of DHS Intel Office. Politico (8/2, Swan, 4.29M) \nreports that \"several months ago, the leadership of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis \nasked\" Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli to limit \"a department watchdog from \nregularly reviewing the intelligence products it produces and distributes.\" Cuccinelli \"signed off \non the move, according to two sources familiar with the situation, which constrained the role of \nthe department's Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in approving the intelligence office's \nwork.\" Since the change, however, \"I&A's work has drawn withering criticism. The Washington \nPost reported last week that the office distributed an intelligence report documenting \ncommunications between protesters over the Telegram messaging app. The Post also reported \nthat I&A compiled intelligence reports on journalists covering DHS's response to protests in \nPortland, Oregon against racism and police brutality.\" A DHS spokesperson declined to \ncomment. \nDC Police Prevent Pro -Life Organizations From Painting \"Black Preborn Lives Matter\" \nOn Street, Arrest Two Activists. \nThe Washington Times (8/1, Richardson, 492K) reports, \"Police stopped pro-life groups \nSaturday from painting 'Black Preborn Lives Matter' on the street in front of a Washington, D.C., \nPlanned Parenthood clinic and subsequently arrested two for writing the message in chalk on a \nEFTA01658031\nsidewalk, even though the activists said they had the District government's permission for the \nstreet painting.\" Leaders from Students for Life of America indicated that they told law \nenforcement \"and city officials during the permit process that they would be painting the \nmessage on the 1200 block of 4th Street NE, citing the precedent of the protesters who painted \n'Defund the Police' in June on 16th Street NW.\" In an email, Students for Life spokesperson \nKristi Hamrick said, \"We were told verbally that we would not be prevented from painting and \nwhat kind of paint to buy.\" \nJayapal Says Barr Perjured Himself During Testimony On Protests. \nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D -WA) said on MSNBC's Politics NationVi (8/2, 932K) that Attorney \nGeneral Barr \"is not the President's personal attorney. He is supposed to be the attorney for all \nAmericans and he is not acting that way. So, when there are protesters who are protesting the \nPresident, like the movement for Black Lives [Matter] protesters, then...a whole series of \nofficers that come and push them out of the way just so that the President can get a photo -op. \n... But when you have right-wing extremists...then somehow the Attorney General is nowhere \nto be found. And I believe he actually perjured himself because he said he wasn't even aware of \nthose protests and that is impossible that as Attorney General he wouldn't be aware of those \nprotests.\" \nTrump Retweets Video Of Fox News Hosts Criticizing House Democrats' \nTreatment Of Barr. President Trump retweeted a post from a Twitter user called The Dirty \nTruth who tweeted video of a segment from Fox News' Watters World during which host Jesse \nWatters said House Democrats' treatment of Barr during his testimony last week was \n\"despicable,\" and Fox News host Mark Levin said, \"I have never seen a senior official of any \nadministration ever treated like that.\" \nArkansas Governor Confident In Investigation Into Morris Death. \nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), on CNN's State Of The UnionVi (8/2, 954K), commented on \na newly released video showing the death of Lionel Morris, who died in police custody. \nHutchinson said, \"I'm confident that the review by the Arkansas state police was thorough and \nthe prosecuting attorney's office, any death like that in custody is a tragedy, but, in this case, \none thing you didn't mention that he was very high on methamphetamine that was in his \nsystem and that was a large part of the reason that he died in custody because of that, as well \nas other contributing factors. I have confidence in the review that was done, in addition one \nthing that we are doing as a result of the George Floyd protests and the tragedy that was there, \nwe do have an ongoing task force to review the advancement of law enforcement and what \ncontrols, changes need to be made there.\" \nNevada Legislature Votes To Ban Police From Using Chokeholds. \nThe Washington Examiner (8/2, Dibble, 448K) reports the Nevada state legislature over the \nweekend passed \"a series of police reforms, including a ban on the use of chokeholds by \nofficers.\" The state Senate and assembly \"each passed separate policing reforms on Saturday\" \nincluding restricting the use of chokeholds \"unless the officer's life is in danger.\" \nCOUNTER -TERRORISM \nUK Goes To Supreme Court To Fight Return Of IS Bride. \nThe AP (7/31, Kirka) reported the British government is going \"to the UK's Supreme Court to \nchallenge the return of a woman who ran away from home as a teenager in London to join the \nIslamic State group.\" A lower appeals court \"ruled earlier this month that Shamima Begum had \nthe right to come back to her home country to mount a legal challenge aimed at restoring her \nBritish citizenship, which was revoked on national security grounds.\" The three -judge Court of \nEFTA01658032\nAppeal panel \"ruled that 'the only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be \npermitted to come into the UK.\" Britain's Home Office \"challenged the decision, arguing that \nBegum doesn't have the right to repatriate.\" A lawyer for the Home Office, James Eadie, \"said \nthere were 'significant national security concerns' surrounding her return.\" \nAfghan Troops Kill Senior Islamic State Militant. \nThe AP (8/2) reports Afghanistan's intelligence service \"said the country's special forces killed a \nhigh-ranking official with the local Islamic State group affiliate in an operation in eastern \nAfghanistan.\" A statement late Saturday by the National Directorate of Security \"said the slain \nmilitant was Assadullah Orakzai, an intelligence leader for the IS affiliate in Afghanistan.\" The \nstatement \"said he was killed near Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.\" Orakzai was \nsuspected of \"being involved in several deadly attacks against both military and civilian targets \nin Afghanistan.\" \nNYTimes Al: Case Of One Extremist Group Shows How Far -Right Infiltration Has \nSpread Throughout German Society. \nIn a roughly 3,200 -word front-page article, the New York Times (8/1, Al, Bennhold, 18.61M) \nexamines the creation of the German group Nordkreuz, or Northern Cross, and how its \nmembers began making plans to \"round up political enemies and those defending migrants and \nrefugees, put them on trucks and drive them to a secret location,\" and then kill them. The \nTimes says, \"The Nordkreuz case, which only recently came to trial after being uncovered more \nthan three years ago, shows that the problem of far-right infiltration\" in Germany \"is neither \nnew nor confined to...the KSK, or even the military. Far-right extremism penetrated multiple \nlayers of German society in the years when the authorities underestimated the threat or were \nreluctant to countenance it fully, officials and lawmakers acknowledge. Now they are struggling \nto uproot it.\" \nCOUNTER -INTELLIGENCE \nJudge Denies Bail For California Researcher Over China Ties. \nThe AP (8/2) reports from Sacramento, California, \"A federal judge in California denied a bail \nrequest for a university researcher accused of lying about her ties to China's military and \nCommunist Party to gain access to the United States.\" US Magistrate Judge Deborah Barnes \n\"said Friday that 37-year -old Juan Tang 'would have every reason to leave' the country if \nreleased on bail. The former Chinese researcher at the University of California Davis has been \nheld without bail at the Sacramento County Main Jail since July 23.\" Tang \"was arrested by FBI \nagents when she left the Chinese consulate in San Francisco to visit a doctor, authorities said. \nTang was considered a fugitive who sought refuge for a month inside the consulate after being \nquestioned June 20.\" The Sacramento (CA) Bee (7/31, 567K) reported Barnes said, \"I just don't \nsee sufficient conditions to overcome flight risk.\" Law360 (7/31, Subscription Publication, 8K) \nreported Barnes \"found it 'highly suspicious' that the defendant's daughter returned to China \nwithout the court's knowledge.\" Stanford University visiting scholar Chen Song is \"one of a \nhandful of scientists who the US has recently charged with visa fraud, claiming they concealed \ntheir active Chinese military duty status in their US visa applications in an orchestrated \nprogram by the Chinese government.\" \nBloomberg (7/31, Rosenblatt, 4.73M) reported Lexi Negin, the public defender \nrepresenting Tang, \"said in an email that she's disappointed by the decision.\" Negin said,\"We \nwill continue to work to try and find a suitable release package for Dr. Tang so that she can \ndefend her case.\" \nWoman Pleads Guilty To Plotting To Steal Trade Secrets From Ohio Hospital. \nEFTA01658033",

O'Toole Jr., 'did not meet the standard' of \nfairness, because he did not sufficiently scrutinize sitting jurors for bias.\" In arguments during \nEFTA01658027\nDecember, attorneys for Tsarnaev \"had pointed to 22 Twitter posts and retweets by the jury's \nforewoman - one referring to Mr. Tsarnaev as `that piece of garbage' - that had not been \nvoluntarily disclosed as part of jury screening.\" \nThe Washington Post (7/31, Sacchetti, 14.2M) reports the case is going to return \"to the \nlower court for additional hearings, but the court's overturning of the death sentences does not \nmean Tsarnaev will have an opportunity to get out of prison.\" The court said, \"Dzhokhar will \nremain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being \nwhether the government will end his life by executing him.\" The Post adds, \"Tsarnaev's federal \ndefenders said in a statement Friday that they were `grateful for the Court's straightforward and \nfair decision.\" \nThe AP (7/31, Richer) reports, \"A three -judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals ordered a new penalty -phase trial on whether the 27-year -old Tsarnaev should be \nexecuted for the attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. `But make \nno mistake: Dzhokhar will spend his remaining days locked up in prison, with the only matter \nremaining being whether he will die by execution,' Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote in the \nruling, more than six months after arguments were heard in the case.\" Prosecutors \"could ask \nthe full appeals court to hear the case or go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" \nUSA Today (7/31, Garrison, 10.31M) reports, \"Prior to his sentencing, attorneys for \nTsarnaev, 19 at the time of the bombings, agreed their client was responsible for the deaths but \ncontended he was less culpable than his accomplice, older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was \nkilled by authorities following a four-day manhunt. A fourth victim, an MIT police officer, was \nshot and killed by the Tsarnaev brothers during the manhunt. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense \nattorneys argued during a December appeal hearing he did not receive a fair trial in Boston \nbefore he was sentenced to death, pointing to relentless media coverage in the city where the \nbombing occurred and city-wide trauma that `filtered' into the jury pool. They said two jurors \nlied by concealing prejudiced remarks made on social media about the case before the trial.\" \nReuters (7/31, Raymond) reports that Judge Thompson \"said the trial judge `fell short' in \nconducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial \npublicity surrounding the high-profile case. Thompson said the pervasive news coverage of the \nbombings and their aftermath featured `bone-chilling' photos and videos of Tsarnaev, now 27, \nand his brother carrying backpacks at the marathon and of those injured and killed near its \nfinish line. Thompson said the judge deemed jurors eligible who had `already formed an opinion \nthat Dzhokhar was guilty - and he did so in large part because they answered \"yes\" to the \nquestion whether they could decide this high-profile case based on the evidence.\" \nThe Hill (7/31, Moreno, 2.98M) reports, \"Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued that his \nsentencing trial should not be held in Boston, where jurors have been exposed to heavy local \nand national media coverage of the attack and its aftermath.\" \nThe AP (8/1, Mustian, Ring) reports, \"'Boston Strong' remains a `vibrant' rallying cry more \nthan seven years after the marathon bombing killed three people and injured more than 260 \nothers, a federal appeals court noted as it threw out the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,\" \nbut \"even as the ruling opened old wounds, it raised familiar questions about whether Tsarnaev \ncan receive a fair hearing in the city where the bombs exploded — a community that may now \nbe asked to relive unspeakable trauma.\" The AP adds, \"The Justice Department is expected to \nappeal. Legal observers predict prosecutors will turn straight to the U.S. Supreme Court without \nasking for a hearing before the full 1st Circuit. The U.S. government recently resumed federal \nexecutions following a 17-year pause and, under President Donald Trump, has pursued capital \npunishment in an increasing number of cases.\" The Hill (8/2, Klar, 2.98M), the Springfield (MA). \nRepublican (8/2, Croteau, 395K), and the Boston Globe (8/1, Crimaldi, 972K) also report. \nThe Wall Street Journal (7/31, Kamp, Randazzo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) as well \nas brief CBS Evening NewsVi (7/31, story 12, 0:19, O'Donnell, 3.97M) and NBC Nightly NewsVi \n(7/31, story 11, 0:20, Holt, 5.44M) broadcasts provided similar coverage. \nEFTA01658028\nTrump Demands Death Penalty For Tsarnaev. The New York Post (8/2, Sheehy, \n4.57M) reports that in a tweet Sunday afternoon, President Trump \"demanded the death \npenalty for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - whose execution was taken off the \ntable by an appellate court last week.\" Trump wrote, \"Rarely has anybody deserved the death \npenalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The court agreed that this \"was one \nof the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities\". Yet the appellate court tossed \nout the death sentence. So many lives lost and ruined. The Federal Government must again \nseek the Death Penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial. Our Country cannot let \nthe appellate decision stand. Also, it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long!\" \nReuters (8/2, Schroeder) reports, \"In a tweet, Trump said the federal government must \nchallenge a Friday appeals court decision overturning the death penalty for the 2013 attack. \n`Rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar \nTsarnaev,' tweeted Trump. `The Federal Government must again seek the Death Penalty in a do-\nover of that chapter of the original trial.\" \nPROTESTS \nPortland Protests Calmer After Federal Agents Stand Down. \nThe Washington Post (8/2, Taylor, Rosenberg, 14.2M) reports that after \"66 straight nights,\" the \nprotests in downtown Portland \"may be reaching a turning point: The weekend brought none of \nthe large-scale tear gas and firework -fueled clashes that marked the previous two months of \nunrest, a potential sign of calming tensions after the Trump administration pulled back federal \nlaw enforcement officers.\" However, it is \"not clear what direction the protests in the city, which \nshow no sign of stopping, will take next.\" \nIn a similar report headlined \"With No Federal Agents On Streets, Portland Protests Turn \nLargely Peaceful,\" the Wall Street Journal (8/2, Caldwell, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says \nthat since Thursday, the first night without a visible federal law enforcement presence, protests \nhave been mostly peaceful. The New York Times (8/2, Baker, 18.61M) too reports that on \nSaturday night, \"the crowd saw a third consecutive night of calm since the start of a plan to \nwithdraw federal agents who had brought a militarized crackdown to the city.\" \nThe AP (7/31, Flaccus) reports that in Portland, there has been a \"dramatic change in tone \noutside a federal courthouse that's become ground zero in clashes between demonstrators and \nfederal agents...after the U.S. government began drawing down its forces under a deal between \nDemocratic Gov. Kate Brown and the Trump administration.\" According to the AP, \"As agents \nfrom U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement pulled back, troopers with the Oregon State Police were supposed to take \nover.\" The AP says \"there were no signs of any law enforcement presence outside the Mark O. \nHatfield Federal Courthouse, however, where a protest lasted into early Friday.\" \nThe Washington Post (7/31, Taylor, 14.2M) also reports that \"as the Black Lives Matter-\ninspired vigil wound down early Friday morning, there was virtually no sign of the Oregon State \nPolice officers who had taken over protection of the federal buildings at the center of the \nprotests.\" According to the Post, \"Instead of being forcibly removed from downtown's Lownsdale \nSquare and the adjacent Chapman Square...the crowd thinned out on its own, with many \nprotesters heading home of their own accord.\" The Post says that \"by a little after 1 a.m., only a \nrelatively small crew remained, far down from the enormous crowd that had gathered four \nhours earlier to listen to speakers and chant anti -law enforcement slogans.\" \nReuters (7/31, Bloom) reports that Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell \"tweeted his thanks \nto protesters who stopped attempts to light fires and throw projectiles on the 63rd night of \ndemonstrations, when there were no arrests.\" While Reuters adds that acting Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Wolf indicated Friday morning that DHS agents \"remained on standby and \nNational Guard troops could be sent in should state police be overrun,\" the Wall Street Journal \nEFTA01658029\n(7/31, Caldwell, Calfas, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says that officials in Portland expect \nthe protests this weekend will be less violent given the drawdown of federal forces. \nTrump: DHS Will Remain In Portland Until Police \"Complete Cleanup Of \nAnarchists And Agitators.\" President Trump on Friday tweeted, \"Homeland Security is not \nleaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!\" \nWolf: Joint Federal -Local Policing Has \"Worked Fairly Well\" In Portland. \nAppearing on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/31, 831K), Wolf said the developments in Portland \n\"worked fairly well. What we saw is we saw a robust contingent of Oregon State Police come \ninto the area yesterday afternoon together with Portland Police Bureau. They cleaned out the \nparks across the street from the courthouse and what we saw overnight is almost little to no \ncriminal activity. And that really is how it should be. It reinforces the principle if you work with \nfederal state and local law enforcement work together we can protect our communities. We can \nsecure our communities. We can secure federal properties and protect law enforcement officers. \nThis is what we have been asking for or over 60 days and I'm glad Oregon and Portland has \nfinally accepted up to the challenge.\" \nCuccinelli Highlights Barr's House Testimony Regarding Portland Protests. \nSpeaking on Chicago's Morning Answer (7/31), Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary \nCuccinelli discussed Attorney General Barr's recent House testimony regarding the presence of \nfederal agents in Portland. Cuccinelli also discussed the DHS' role in protecting federal property, \nincluding the federal courthouse. \nUS Marshals Discuss Portland Protests, Role In Protecting Federal Courthouse. \nAppearing on NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/31, story 13, 1:58, Holt, 5.44M), US Marshals Service \nDirector Donald Washington and US Marshall Russel Burger discussed the protests in Portland \nand their role in protecting the federal courthouse. Washington said, \"People should be yelling, \nshouting from the courthouse steps their grievances, not trying to burn it to the ground.\" When \nasked by NBC's Erin McLaughlin, \"Who are these people that are doing this?,\" Burger \nresponded, \"We have legitimate protesters that are out there expressing their First Amendment \nright, and we support that. But then you've got this other group, they want nothing more than \nto create chaos and injure people. And it's not a big group.\" \nJudge Allows Release Of 18 -Year -Old Accused Of Attempted Arson At Portland \nCourthouse. The Oregonian (7/31, Bernstein, 1M) reports Gabriel Agard-Berryhill, 18, \"made \nhis first appearance in federal court Friday on an attempted arson allegation, accused of lighting \nand throwing a large firework Tuesday over the fence that struck and set on fire protective \nwood covering the entrance to the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse.\" The Oregonian \nadds US Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo \"allowed Agard-Berryhill to be released,\" but he \"must \nnot come within a five -block radius of the courthouse at any time of the day or night while his \ncase is pending.\" \nJudge May Order Federal Agents To Wear Numbered Jerseys. Politico (7/31, \nGerstein, 4.29M) reports US District Court Judge Michael Simon on Friday suggested the \nuniforms of federal agents \"responding to long -running protests and unrest in that city be \nemblazoned with easily visible numbers so officers can be easily identified if they commit \nabuses.\" Politico says Simon's comments came \"in connection with a lawsuit he's overseeing \nthat accuses city police and federal law enforcement officers of unjustified use of force against \njournalists and legal observers monitoring the protests, which have centered in recent weeks on \nthe main federal courthouse in Portland.\" \nPoll: 53% Support Deployment To Protect Federal Property, 475 Opposed. The \nHill (7/31, Schulte, 2.98M) reports a Hill-HarrisX poll of 948 \"registered voters\" (7/26-7/27) \nfound 53% \"said they support sending federal agents to major cities in order to protect federal \nproperty despite the mayors of those cities not making a request for such action,\" while 47% \n\"opposed the Trump administration's move.\" However, The Hill adds the survey \"fell heavily \nalong party lines with 76 percent of Republican respondents saying they agreed with the use of \nfederal troops to protect federal property while 77 percent of Democrats said they disagree with \nEFTA01658030\nthe move. Fifty-five percent of independent voters said they disagree with the move. The \nsurvey found 55 percent of white voters agree with federal agents and officers being deployed \ninto major cities to protect federal property. Twenty-one percent of Black voters said they \noppose the move along with 33 percent of Hispanic voters.\" \nDHS Official Whose Office Compiled Intelligence Regarding Journalists Gets \nReassigned. \nThe New York Times (8/1, Kanno-Youngs, Goldman, 18.61M) reports Department of Homeland \nSecurity Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Brian Murphy was reassigned \n\"after his office compiled reports about protesters and journalists covering the Trump \nadministration's response to unrest in Portland, Ore., last month.\" Murphy was moved \"to a new \nposition in [DHS) after his office disseminated to the law enforcement community 'open -source \nintelligence reports' containing Twitter posts of journalists, noting they had published leaked \nunclassified documents, according to an administration official familiar with the matter.\" The \nTimes adds, \"It was not clear what Mr. Murphy's new position would be.\" \nThe Washington Post (8/1, Harris, Miroff, 14.2M) reports the decision to remove Murphy \nfrom his job was made on Friday by Acting DHS Secretary Wolf. DHS \"has been under mounting \nscrutiny from lawmakers and civil liberties groups over its use of federal law enforcement \nofficers to quell protests in Portland and in light of President Trump's threat to deploy federal \npersonnel to other cities that he asserts are being overrun by violent criminals.\" \nDHS Stops Collecting Intel On Reporters Covering Portland Response. The New \nYork Times (7/31, Kanno-Youngs, Tracy, 18.61M) reports DHS spokesman Alexei Woltornist \n\"said on Friday that [Wolf] had shut down an intelligence examination of the work of reporters \ncovering the government's response to protests in Portland, Ore., beginning an investigation \ninto what he suggested was an infringement on First Amendment rights.\" Woltornist said, \"The \nacting secretary is committed to ensuring that all D.H.S. personnel uphold the principles of \nprofessionalism, impartiality and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it \nrelates to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\" Woltornist added Wolf ordered DHS to \n\"immediately discontinue collecting information involving members of the press\" once he \nlearned of its actions. \nMeanwhile, Reuters (7/31, Hosenball) reports all seven Democrats on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee on Friday \"wrote to the Department of Homeland Security requesting \ndetails on its agents conducting intelligence monitoring of ongoing anti -racism protests in \nPortland.\" \nCuccinelli Relaxed Oversight Of DHS Intel Office. Politico (8/2, Swan, 4.29M) \nreports that \"several months ago, the leadership of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis \nasked\" Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli to limit \"a department watchdog from \nregularly reviewing the intelligence products it produces and distributes.\" Cuccinelli \"signed off \non the move, according to two sources familiar with the situation, which constrained the role of \nthe department's Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in approving the intelligence office's \nwork.\" Since the change, however, \"I&A's work has drawn withering criticism. The Washington \nPost reported last week that the office distributed an intelligence report documenting \ncommunications between protesters over the Telegram messaging app. The Post also reported \nthat I&A compiled intelligence reports on journalists covering DHS's response to protests in \nPortland, Oregon against racism and police brutality.\" A DHS spokesperson declined to \ncomment. \nDC Police Prevent Pro -Life Organizations From Painting \"Black Preborn Lives Matter\" \nOn Street, Arrest Two Activists. \nThe Washington Times (8/1, Richardson, 492K) reports, \"Police stopped pro-life groups \nSaturday from painting 'Black Preborn Lives Matter' on the street in front of a Washington, D.C., \nPlanned Parenthood clinic and subsequently arrested two for writing the message in chalk on a \nEFTA01658031\nsidewalk, even though the activists said they had the District government's permission for the \nstreet painting.\" Leaders from Students for Life of America indicated that they told law \nenforcement \"and city officials during the permit process that they would be painting the \nmessage on the 1200 block of 4th Street NE, citing the precedent of the protesters who painted \n'Defund the Police' in June on 16th Street NW.\" In an email, Students for Life spokesperson \nKristi Hamrick said, \"We were told verbally that we would not be prevented from painting and \nwhat kind of paint to buy.\" \nJayapal Says Barr Perjured Himself During Testimony On Protests. \nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D -WA) said on MSNBC's Politics NationVi (8/2, 932K) that Attorney \nGeneral Barr \"is not the President's personal attorney. He is supposed to be the attorney for all \nAmericans and he is not acting that way. So, when there are protesters who are protesting the \nPresident, like the movement for Black Lives [Matter] protesters, then...a whole series of \nofficers that come and push them out of the way just so that the President can get a photo -op. \n... But when you have right-wing extremists...then somehow the Attorney General is nowhere \nto be found. And I believe he actually perjured himself because he said he wasn't even aware of \nthose protests and that is impossible that as Attorney General he wouldn't be aware of those \nprotests.\" \nTrump Retweets Video Of Fox News Hosts Criticizing House Democrats' \nTreatment Of Barr. President Trump retweeted a post from a Twitter user called The Dirty \nTruth who tweeted video of a segment from Fox News' Watters World during which host Jesse \nWatters said House Democrats' treatment of Barr during his testimony last week was \n\"despicable,\" and Fox News host Mark Levin said, \"I have never seen a senior official of any \nadministration ever treated like that.\" \nArkansas Governor Confident In Investigation Into Morris Death. \nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), on CNN's State Of The UnionVi (8/2, 954K), commented on \na newly released video showing the death of Lionel Morris, who died in police custody. \nHutchinson said, \"I'm confident that the review by the Arkansas state police was thorough and \nthe prosecuting attorney's office, any death like that in custody is a tragedy, but, in this case, \none thing you didn't mention that he was very high on methamphetamine that was in his \nsystem and that was a large part of the reason that he died in custody because of that, as well \nas other contributing factors. I have confidence in the review that was done, in addition one \nthing that we are doing as a result of the George Floyd protests and the tragedy that was there, \nwe do have an ongoing task force to review the advancement of law enforcement and what \ncontrols, changes need to be made there.\" \nNevada Legislature Votes To Ban Police From Using Chokeholds. \nThe Washington Examiner (8/2, Dibble, 448K) reports the Nevada state legislature over the \nweekend passed \"a series of police reforms, including a ban on the use of chokeholds by \nofficers.\" The state Senate and assembly \"each passed separate policing reforms on Saturday\" \nincluding restricting the use of chokeholds \"unless the officer's life is in danger.\" \nCOUNTER -TERRORISM \nUK Goes To Supreme Court To Fight Return Of IS Bride. \nThe AP (7/31, Kirka) reported the British government is going \"to the UK's Supreme Court to \nchallenge the return of a woman who ran away from home as a teenager in London to join the \nIslamic State group.\" A lower appeals court \"ruled earlier this month that Shamima Begum had \nthe right to come back to her home country to mount a legal challenge aimed at restoring her \nBritish citizenship, which was revoked on national security grounds.\" The three -judge Court of \nEFTA01658032\nAppeal panel \"ruled that 'the only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be \npermitted to come into the UK.\" Britain's Home Office \"challenged the decision, arguing that \nBegum doesn't have the right to repatriate.\" A lawyer for the Home Office, James Eadie, \"said \nthere were 'significant national security concerns' surrounding her return.\" \nAfghan Troops Kill Senior Islamic State Militant. \nThe AP (8/2) reports Afghanistan's intelligence service \"said the country's special forces killed a \nhigh-ranking official with the local Islamic State group affiliate in an operation in eastern \nAfghanistan.\" A statement late Saturday by the National Directorate of Security \"said the slain \nmilitant was Assadullah Orakzai, an intelligence leader for the IS affiliate in Afghanistan.\" The \nstatement \"said he was killed near Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.\" Orakzai was \nsuspected of \"being involved in several deadly attacks against both military and civilian targets \nin Afghanistan.\" \nNYTimes Al: Case Of One Extremist Group Shows How Far -Right Infiltration Has \nSpread Throughout German Society. \nIn a roughly 3,200 -word front-page article, the New York Times (8/1, Al, Bennhold, 18.61M) \nexamines the creation of the German group Nordkreuz, or Northern Cross, and how its \nmembers began making plans to \"round up political enemies and those defending migrants and \nrefugees, put them on trucks and drive them to a secret location,\" and then kill them. The \nTimes says, \"The Nordkreuz case, which only recently came to trial after being uncovered more \nthan three years ago, shows that the problem of far-right infiltration\" in Germany \"is neither \nnew nor confined to...the KSK, or even the military. Far-right extremism penetrated multiple \nlayers of German society in the years when the authorities underestimated the threat or were \nreluctant to countenance it fully, officials and lawmakers acknowledge. Now they are struggling \nto uproot it.\" \nCOUNTER -INTELLIGENCE \nJudge Denies Bail For California Researcher Over China Ties. \nThe AP (8/2) reports from Sacramento, California, \"A federal judge in California denied a bail \nrequest for a university researcher accused of lying about her ties to China's military and \nCommunist Party to gain access to the United States.\" US Magistrate Judge Deborah Barnes \n\"said Friday that 37-year -old Juan Tang 'would have every reason to leave' the country if \nreleased on bail. The former Chinese researcher at the University of California Davis has been \nheld without bail at the Sacramento County Main Jail since July 23.\" Tang \"was arrested by FBI \nagents when she left the Chinese consulate in San Francisco to visit a doctor, authorities said. \nTang was considered a fugitive who sought refuge for a month inside the consulate after being \nquestioned June 20.\" The Sacramento (CA) Bee (7/31, 567K) reported Barnes said, \"I just don't \nsee sufficient conditions to overcome flight risk.\" Law360 (7/31, Subscription Publication, 8K) \nreported Barnes \"found it 'highly suspicious' that the defendant's daughter returned to China \nwithout the court's knowledge.\" Stanford University visiting scholar Chen Song is \"one of a \nhandful of scientists who the US has recently charged with visa fraud, claiming they concealed \ntheir active Chinese military duty status in their US visa applications in an orchestrated \nprogram by the Chinese government.\" \nBloomberg (7/31, Rosenblatt, 4.73M) reported Lexi Negin, the public defender \nrepresenting Tang, \"said in an email that she's disappointed by the decision.\" Negin said,\"We \nwill continue to work to try and find a suitable release package for Dr. Tang so that she can \ndefend her case.\" \nWoman Pleads Guilty To Plotting To Steal Trade Secrets From Ohio Hospital. \nEFTA01658033"

Alain is the subject that Peter \nuses for his studies. \nBriefly where we were was: \nI) The \"Evolving caravan\" and events to identify scientists and people with special abilities (more subjects for \nresearch). \n2) Research methodologies and experiments that stand up to rigour (network of labs and researchers around \nthe world, common protocols, Ideally you can also support Peter who is part of this, etc.). 2nd person research \nmethodologies (we haven't talked about this). I am seeing NYU and Columbia University faculty later today \nto talk about this. \n3) \"Polystery\" for rehabilitating \"stage 3\" people (examples like Edd who have gifts, but are not able to \nsupport themselves). Have a sustainable model for this. Also supports (1). Builds community and eco-\nsystem. \nWould like to build a global network. We didn't even talk about China and work there or Cuba. \nWould like to apply the 60-75k allocated from last year to pilot some of this. Wanted to see if we could \nestablish some metrics that could lead to more funding if we are successful. \nThe benefits to you are: \nI) More interesting people to meet. \n2) Helping to develop a theory of development and human potential. \n3) Advancing knowledge and experimental methodologies (e.g., 2nd person methodologies). \n4) Adds a new dimension to the interests that you already have in music, language, and psychology. \n5) Provide services that are unique for the community of people that you know (e.g., high stage 2, low stage 3 \npeople). There are new models such as the initial proposition I made to you last year (collaborating on \ndeveloping a service to \"shift\" people that are unhappy. \n6) Potentially build a community of people that can do amazing things together (Joscha, Masha, etc.) that can \nalso provide support for (4). \ngino \nEFTA00956942\nP.S. \nTo refresh the model: https://photos.google.corn/share/AF1QipOBQa4z8TRJ7B0XwvassIgeBX \npB7rmnXAs3FZQyuVQx8w2Hpze3yG lqp2wNSIFLA?key=RGR3MGNYaW1LSTZMX2RaSzJIR2RjQl \nZQaUxQTE5R \nPPS \nAK SP 1000: https://www.head-fforg/threads/new-tol-a-k-dap-the-ak-ultima-sp1000.850061/.

      "body": "Dear Jeffrey, \nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. \nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and \ncohesive when I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would \ntrigger Noam (who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even \nthough he did not feel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work \nfocused on the idea that humans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his \nfield began to have other ideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. \nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is \nsomehow a cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we \ndon't know that, but it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between \nhumans and apes is not a very intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. \nThe bootstrapping of cognition works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer \ntakes between a few months and a few years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not \nmuch going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low level learning is finished, it does not change \nvery much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child development, that have famously been \ndescribed by Piaget. \nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. \nThe switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more \nquickly in other apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months \nbefore their brains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many \nAfrican populations are quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in \nmotor development, even in very poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind \n(and never catch up) in cognitive development even after controlling for family income. \nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers \nat 3-4 years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each \nEFTA00823298\nphase, their brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla \nbrain. Humans are literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels \ndepend on those of the lower levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never \nlearn, no matter how much we try to train them. \nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay \nattention to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving \npuzzles, the individual will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets \nlots of rewards for discovering other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. \nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans: \n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set \nof phonemes or the first language) \n- more layers \n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that \nmakes us like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy \nmaking themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning \nfigures out on its own. \nThis is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is \nreflected for instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In \nindividuals of the same group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) \nAnother support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn \nvisual and auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic \nimage recognition into their current photo app: \nlimits-of-algorithms/ \nThe state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to \"imagine\" things. I.e. when the \nexperimenter asks the system to \"dream\" what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a \nsomewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is \nsomething nobody could do a few months ago: \nhttp://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-\ngenerator-networks \nA machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision \nor hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about \n130 lines of Python code. \nThese models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They \ncurrently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn \nobject features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost \neverything else is missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, \nand that we can learn motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al \ndo not work on this, however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) \nNoam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that \nGoogle and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, \nand relate concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental \nrepresentations of what objects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably \none of the top layers of the learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a \nmental world, not before. Classical linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. \nIt seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because \nEFTA00823299\nconcepts are shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from \nthe statistics of language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer \nwhat objects look like and how they interact. \nMy own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The \n\"request-confirmation networks\" that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are \nan attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. \nCheers! \nJoscha \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

          "body": "Some thoughts I meant to send back for a long time: \nEFTA00823295\nno worry, if i understand correctly you are suggsting there are layers 1 through N . lets cal them L \n1 - Ln. there are times T 1- Tn / and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by \ngenetic swtch or other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for \nmotor layer development and changing the time for other layers.. ). like telemeres for the cell , are \ntheir equivalents for the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each \nneuron in each layer would get dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ). \nExactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never \ncatch up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster \nmotor development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because \nthe low-level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor \ndevelopment, because it is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get \nthe structures in place. \nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a \nmore hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal \npatterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc. \nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of \ntime , and structure of interactions. . \nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different \nsocial and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay \nattention and learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract \nsystems, conflicts and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write \nprograms because they enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. \nThere are almost no women in math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. \nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing \nwith people, one will not have good social cognition. \nIQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I \nsuspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually \nindependent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard \nto find in Asia. \nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to \nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the \nresult in a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us \ninterested in music. \nIt would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical \nlanguage, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational \nurge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a \nnatural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. \ni my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure \nof those layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic \nmovments best describe your layering. they open with a basic simple melody, after it is learned , it \nis repeated and \" developed \" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long \nEFTA00823296\ntime. then there is a recapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has \nlots of beats. and little development. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process. \nInteresting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It \ncould be path effects, starting in culture. \nre taboo \n, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. . the earths forest fire. \npotentailly a good thing for the species \nMaking having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a \nmore humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have \nmore children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at \nprocreation. Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions \nof any given population die. \nI suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The \nclimate change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But \nwho knows, I might be wrong. \ntoo many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense \nis the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not \nearilier. if the brain discards unused neurons , why shold socieity keep their equivalent \nThe radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized \norganism is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if \nsomeone could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes \nit a virus that everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very \nuncomfortable (I visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East \nGermans inoculated ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be \nwilling to consider it. \nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which \nexplores what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to \nfunction as a brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is \nvery dark, but not a flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship \nTroopers\" explores fascism, too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as \nthe most desirable order. \nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly \nsignaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage \nin your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of \nperson you want to transform into. \nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything \nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy \nstill works\", and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see \nin others, hard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media \"stifle all criticism of Trump\", another wanted to \nremove \"men and Elon Musk from government\", and everybody strongly agreed that we need more \ndiversity everywhere. \nEFTA00823297\nI noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, \ninsight-laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his \naudience with symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates \nwith them. The non-controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very \nsubversive, while rarely offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance). \nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for \nhim. This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. \nVery few of his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears \nfrom others. \nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. \nJoi is right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals. \nBests, \nJoscha"

          "body": "Dear Jeffrey, \nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. \nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and \ncohesive when I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would \ntrigger Noam (who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even \nthough he did not feel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work \nfocused on the idea that humans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his \nfield began to have other ideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. \nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is \nsomehow a cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we \ndon't know that, but it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between \nhumans and apes is not a very intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. \nThe bootstrapping of cognition works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer \ntakes between a few months and a few years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not \nmuch going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low level learning is finished, it does not change \nvery much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child development, that have famously been \ndescribed by Piaget. \nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. \nThe switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more \nquickly in other apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months \nbefore their brains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many \nAfrican populations are quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in \nmotor development, even in very poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind \n(and never catch up) in cognitive development even after controlling for family income. \nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers \nat 3-4 years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each \nEFTA00823298\nphase, their brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla \nbrain. Humans are literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels \ndepend on those of the lower levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never \nlearn, no matter how much we try to train them. \nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay \nattention to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving \npuzzles, the individual will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets \nlots of rewards for discovering other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. \nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans: \n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set \nof phonemes or the first language) \n- more layers \n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that \nmakes us like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy \nmaking themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning \nfigures out on its own. \nThis is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is \nreflected for instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In \nindividuals of the same group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) \nAnother support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn \nvisual and auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic \nimage recognition into their current photo app: \nlimits-of-algorithms/ \nThe state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to \"imagine\" things. I.e. when the \nexperimenter asks the system to \"dream\" what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a \nsomewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is \nsomething nobody could do a few months ago: \nhttp://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-\ngenerator-networks \nA machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision \nor hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about \n130 lines of Python code. \nThese models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They \ncurrently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn \nobject features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost \neverything else is missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, \nand that we can learn motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al \ndo not work on this, however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) \nNoam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that \nGoogle and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, \nand relate concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental \nrepresentations of what objects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably \none of the top layers of the learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a \nmental world, not before. Classical linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. \nIt seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because \nEFTA00823299\nconcepts are shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from \nthe statistics of language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer \nwhat objects look like and how they interact. \nMy own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The \n\"request-confirmation networks\" that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are \nan attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. \nCheers! \nJoscha \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never \ncatch up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster \nmotor development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because \nthe low-level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, \nbecause it is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures \nin place. \nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a \nmore hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal \npatterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc. \nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time \n, and structure of interactions. . \nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different \nsocial and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay \nattention and learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract \nsystems, conflicts and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write \nprograms because they enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. \nThere are almost no women in math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. \nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing \nwith people, one will not have good social cognition. \nIQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I \nsuspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually \nindependent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to \nfind in Asia. \nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to \nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result \nin a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested \nin music. \nIt would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical \nlanguage, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational \nurge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a \nnatural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. \ni my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of \nthose layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic \nmovments best describe your layering. they open with a basic simple melody, after it is learned , it is \nrepeated and \" developed \" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. \nthen there is a recapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of \nbeats. and little development. - no accident, it minors their learning process. \nInteresting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could \nbe path effects, starting in culture. \nre taboo \nEFTA00823282\n, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. . the earths forest fire. \npotentailly a good thing for the species \nMaking having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a \nmore humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more \nchildren, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. \nHumans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given \npopulation die. \nI suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate \nchange itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who \nknows, I might be wrong. \ntoo many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense \nis the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not \nearilier. if the brain discards unused neurons , why shold socieity keep their equivalent \nThe radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized \norganism is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if \nsomeone could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it \na virus that everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very \nuncomfortable (I visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East \nGermans inoculated ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing \nto consider it. \nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which \nexplores what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to \nfunction as a brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very \ndark, but not a flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship Troopers\" \nexplores fascism, too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most \ndesirable order. \nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly \nsignaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in \nyour youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of \nperson you want to transform into. \nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything \nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy \nstill works\", and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in \nothers, hard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media \"stifle all criticism of Trump\", another wanted to \nremove \"men and Elon Musk from government\", and everybody strongly agreed that we need more \ndiversity everywhere. \nI noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, \ninsight-laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his \naudience with symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates \nwith them. The non-controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very \nsubversive, while rarely offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance). \nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for \nhim. This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. \nEFTA00823283\nVery few of his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears \nfrom others. \nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. \nJoi is right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals. \nBests, \nJoscha"

          "body": "Dear Jeffrey, \nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. \nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive \nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam \n(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did \nnot feel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea \nthat humans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have \nother ideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. \nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is \nsomehow a cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we \ndon't know that, but it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans \nand apes is not a very intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The \nbootstrapping of cognition works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes \nbetween a few months and a few years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much \ngoing on in the higher layers yet, and after the low level learning is finished, it does not change very \nmuch. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child development, that have famously been described \nby Piaget. \nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. \nThe switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more \nquickly in other apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months \nbefore their brains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many \nAfrican populations are quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor \ndevelopment, even in very poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never \ncatch up) in cognitive development even after controlling for family income. \nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at \n3-4 years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, \ntheir brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. \nHumans are literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on \nthose of the lower levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter \nhow much we try to train them. \nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay \nattention to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, \nEFTA00823284\nthe individual will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of \nrewards for discovering other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. \nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans: \n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set \nof phonemes or the first language) \n- more layers \n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that \nmakes us like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy \nmaking themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures \nout on its own. \nThis is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected \nfor instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the \nsame group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) \nAnother support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn \nvisual and auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic \nimage recognition into their current photo app: \nlimits-of-algorithms/ \nThe state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to \"imagine\" things. I.e. when the \nexperimenter asks the system to \"dream\" what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a \nsomewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is \nsomething nobody could do a few months ago: \nhttp://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-\ngenerator-networks \nA machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision \nor hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about \n130 lines of Python code. \nThese models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They \ncurrently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn \nobject features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything \nelse is missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we \ncan learn motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in AI do not work \non this, however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) \nNoam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that \nGoogle and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, \nand relate concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental representations \nof what objects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top \nlayers of the learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not \nbefore. Classical linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. \nIt seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because \nconcepts are shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the \nstatistics of language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what \nobjects look like and how they interact. \nMy own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The \n\"request -confirmation networks\" that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are \nan attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. \nEFTA00823285\nCheers! \nJoscha \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

      "body": "Jeffrey: \nI am back from Davos (a circus.. last time I will go) and Belgium where 2000 people came to \nsee Unbelievers and then listen to Richard and me be interviewed for 90 mins.. With all the \nrecent terrorism they had made a number of security arrangements, and this was the first time \nI was registered in a hotel under someone else's name, and had plainclothes police with us \neverywhere.. but of course there were no worries and no problem in the end. \nI am meeting with MCC and Rob Page on Friday to talk about Origins. With your $2M gift I \nam very pleased to say that I was able to lure Amelia Huggins to be COO/Exec Director. She \nis fantastic.. I am hoping to complete the University approval for her appointment tomorrow, \nand it will be the beginning of trying to have someone take over much of the strategic \norganization etc.. I hope you can meet her sometime. We will then make other hires.. and are \nbeginning planning for a host of possibilities. \nOn a different tack, several different media projects have been proposed to me as possible \nexec, including one on Benjamin Franklin for which the screenplay is written and for which \nvarious major hollywood figures (Jack Nicholson etc) are considering being involved, and for \nwhich they have asked me to talk to Elon Musk about funding and have also have been \nthinking of working in that with perhaps something on Thomas Paine by Gus and Luke... all \nwith an idea of introducing rationalism and free thought gently into the cultural mainstream \n(and frankly it could bring in potentially some significant bucks as exec producer if any took \noff). I know you think this is probably a distraction, but I work best with many irons in the \nfire, and I like the idea in principle or seeing what might come of that.. with zero expectation.. \nIn the meantime,on a less virtual realm in spite of the fact that I expect you will trash it, I \nagreed to help produce (essentially just seeing if I could raise some money for them) a doc \nfilm being produced by a well established production company. I am enclosing \n(confidentially of course) a link to one of their longer trailers for the project, being produced \nwith PBS in mind, that tells a compelling story about this guy in Louisiana. So, below I am \nsending you the link to the trailer. Watch it and tell me if you find it at all interesting... It is \nEFTA00865453\naimed at just telling this guy's story and not ramming anything down anyone's throat.. in fact I \nthink, from what I can see, that it paints the american atheist org. in a somewhat dark light.. \nAnyway I agreed to potentially Exec Produce and try and raise $125K for them if I can... \nThey are considering two models for investments.. a nonprofit model (they have nonprofit \nstatus) or an investor model with some possible 25% backend distribution back to \ninvestors..but most docs make no money so that is probably not a good option.. Anyway, \nlook at it again to see if you are interested putting anything in. In the interest of full disclosure \nI should say that they have offered me as Exec Producer 5% commission for funding for the \nfilm, but that is not the reason I agreed to help them. I think it is an interesting and useful \nproject potentially. I have no expectation that you would want to kick in, but since I was \nlooking at it tonight and probably will talk to you this week I thought I would send it to you. \nLooking forward to seeing you in March.. if you also want to Skype with Amelia once we get \nher on board for Origins that is fine.. Also, today was the final deadline for letters for the \npostdoc scholars.. they look incredible... \nWe are loving Portland.. our furniture finally arrived from OZ, and we now have a house full \nof boxes. :) Unfortunately we were so overwhelmed with other things we never managed to \ntransfer the $400K from OZ so we have seen the exchange rate drop from 87 cents to 79 \ncents.. hoping perhaps it goes up to 82 cents or so and then we will move I guess.. meaning we \nwill only have lost about $20K by waiting.. :( That is why I am not a financier.. I keep \nbuying high and selling low..:) \nTalk soon? \nAll best, \nLawrence \np.s. talked to some Reuters guy today.. Your lawyer keeps foisting them on me.. but hopefully \nthis is the last. I keep telling them to write about something that actually matters.. \nlong version: password: Jerry \nLawrence M.

I am hoping to complete the University approval for her appointment tomorrow, \nand it will be the beginning of trying to have someone take over much of the strategic \norganization etc.. I hope you can meet her sometime. We will then make other hires.. and are \nbeginning planning for a host of possibilities. \nOn a different tack, several different media projects have been proposed to me as possible \nexec, including one on Benjamin Franklin for which the screenplay is written and for which \nvarious major hollywood figures (Jack Nicholson etc) are considering being involved, and for \nwhich they have asked me to talk to Elon Musk about funding and have also have been \nthinking of working in that with perhaps something on Thomas Paine by Gus and Luke... all \nwith an idea of introducing rationalism and free thought gently into the cultural mainstream \n(and frankly it could bring in potentially some significant bucks as exec producer if any took \noff).

I am enclosing \n(confidentially of course) a link to one of their longer trailers for the project, being produced \nwith PBS in mind, that tells a compelling story about this guy in Louisiana.

Anyway, \nlook at it again to see if you are interested putting anything in. In the interest of full disclosure \nI should say that they have offered me as Exec Producer 5% commission for funding for the \nfilm, but that is not the reason I agreed to help them. I think it is an interesting and useful \nproject potentially. I have no expectation that you would want to kick in, but since I was \nlooking at it tonight and probably will talk to you this week I thought I would send it to you. \nLooking forward to seeing you in March.. if you also want to Skype with Amelia once we get \nher on board for Origins that is fine.. Also, today was the final deadline for letters for the \npostdoc scholars.. they look incredible... \nWe are loving Portland.. our furniture finally arrived from OZ, and we now have a house full \nof boxes. :) Unfortunately we were so overwhelmed with other things we never managed to \ntransfer the $400K from OZ so we have seen the exchange rate drop from 87 cents to 79 \ncents.. hoping perhaps it goes up to 82 cents or so and then we will move I guess.. meaning we \nwill only have lost about $20K by waiting.. :( That is why I am not a financier..

          "body": "Jeffrey: \nEFTA00865442\nI am back from Davos (a circus.. last time I will go) and Belgium where 2000 people came to \nsee Unbelievers and then listen to Richard and me be interviewed for 90 mins.. With all the \nrecent terrorism they had made a number of security arrangements, and this was the first time I \nwas registered in a hotel under someone else's name, and had plainclothes police with us \neverywhere.. but of course there were no worries and no problem in the end. \nI am meeting with MCC and Rob Page on Friday to talk about Origins. With your $2M gift I \nam very pleased to say that I was able to lure Amelia Huggins to be COO/Exec Director. She is \nfantastic.. I am hoping to complete the University approval for her appointment tomorrow, and \nit will be the beginning of trying to have someone take over much of the strategic organization \netc.. I hope you can meet her sometime. We will then make other hires.. and are beginning \nplanning for a host of possibilities. \nOn a different tack, several different media projects have been proposed to me as possible exec, \nincluding one on Benjamin Franklin for which the screenplay is written and for which various \nmajor hollywood figures (Jack Nicholson etc) are considering being involved, and for which \nthey have asked me to talk to Elon Musk about funding and have also have been thinking of \nworking in that with perhaps something on Thomas Paine by Gus and Luke... all with an idea \nof introducing rationalism and free thought gently into the cultural mainstream (and frankly it \ncould bring in potentially some significant bucks as exec producer if any took off). I know you \nthink this is probably a distraction, but I work best with many irons in the fire, and I like the \nidea in principle or seeing what might come of that.. with zero expectation.. \nIn the meantime,on a less virtual realm in spite of the fact that I expect you will trash it, I \nagreed to help produce (essentially just seeing if I could raise some money for them) a doc film \nbeing produced by a well established production company. I am enclosing (confidentially of \ncourse) a link to one of their longer trailers for the project, being produced with PBS in mind, \nthat tells a compelling story about this guy in Louisiana. So, below I am sending you the link to \nthe trailer. Watch it and tell me if you find it at all interesting... It is aimed at just telling this \nguy's story and not ramming anything down anyone's throat.. in fact I think, from what I can \nsee, that it paints the american atheist org. in a somewhat dark light.. \nAnyway I agreed to potentially Exec Produce and try and raise $125K for them if I can... They \nare considering two models for investments.. a nonprofit model (they have nonprofit status) or \nan investor model with some possible 25% backend distribution back to investors..but most \ndoes make no money so that is probably not a good option.. Anyway, look at it again to see if \nyou are interested putting anything in. In the interest of full disclosure I should say that they \nhave offered me as Exec Producer 5% commission for funding for the film, but that is not the \nreason I agreed to help them. I think it is an interesting and useful project potentially. I have no \nexpectation that you would want to kick in, but since I was looking at it tonight and probably \nwill talk to you this week I thought I would send it to you. \nLooking forward to seeing you in March.. if you also want to Skype with Amelia once we get \nher on board for Origins that is fine.. Also, today was the final deadline for letters for the \npostdoc scholars.. they look incredible... \nWe are loving Portland.. our furniture finally arrived from OZ, and we now have a house full of \nboxes. :) Unfortunately we were so overwhelmed with other things we never managed to \ntransfer the $400K from OZ so we have seen the exchange rate drop from 87 cents to 79 cents.. \nhoping perhaps it goes up to 82 cents or so and then we will move I guess.. meaning we will \nonly have lost about $20K by waiting.. :( That is why I am not a financier.. I keep buying high \nand selling low.. :) \nTalk soon? \nEFTA00865443\nAll best, \nLawrence \np.s. talked to some Reuters guy today.. Your lawyer keeps foisting them on me.. but hopefully \nthis is the last. I keep telling them to write about something that actually matters.. \nlong version: password: Jerry \nLawrence M.

I didn't want to bother anyone with my \npersonal problems but I see now that was a bad move. I reached out to Sue and Sarah on tues \nabout the when was the next day I can plan to cook for you and they were unsure. Its again my \nfault for not comunicating that I was very ill to someone. I have discharge papers and doctors \nnotes if someone needs to see them. \nI am however back in full swing of things as of yesterday and can send jerky out today if you'd \nlike. Also not sure about how your diet is going but if there are any requests for this coming week \nplease let me know and I'll get started on them now. Stews, pies, steaks? \nVery sony about not communicating \nFrancis"

The remaining 2 lenses that DP have would require the projector either be moved closer or farther away which \nobviously is not an option. \nAnother projector we recommend is the DLA-RS65 reference series by JVC \n) This is an extremely solid \nmodel and falls into the principal's price range, it's THX certified and offers over 120,000:1 native contrast ratio. Similar \nto the Sony that's currently there the video processing of the JVC is exactly how the filmmaker intended them to be \ndisplayed. The price of this model is $12,250 and we can get it within days. Let me know if you have any questions. \nBest \nJeff \nJeff 5ternhell \nVice President \nCutting Edge Systems \n \nEFTA00647148",

Normal procedure is we plug the \nnumbers into DP's calculator, price customer is willing to spend, distance from projector to the screen and the size of the \nlift or area where the projector will live and it gives us the model that will work. If DP models don't work then we move \nEFTA00647146\ndown the list JVC, Sharp, Epson, NEC and so on until we find something that fits into the parameters needed. Any and all \nequipment we recommend and are dealers of have been thoroughly tested and vetted for performance and quality. Our \nclients come first and we would never recommend anything, whether it's a projector or a DVD player, that we don't \nstand behind 100%. \nThe Sony model that's currently there is a 3000:1 contrast ratio with a lumens of 1600. The JVC we are recommending is \n120,000:1 contrast ratio and a lumens of 1200, this is the highest contrast ratio in the industry. It is full 1080p HD and is \ncapable of up to 4x HD, the lens is a built in motorized lens that allows zoom and focus for different screen sizes and can \nachieve Cinemascope without the need of a anamorphic lens. There will be no issue with the lens as we had with the DP \nand from my conversations with Richard who told me about searching the country for the last lens available for the Sony \na few years back. This projector is also 3D ready. \nI feel totally comfortable recommending this projector especially with it working within the confines of the price \nspecified by the principal.

These 2 models are geared more for commercial applications in large rooms such as \nshowrooms and corporate presentations where ambient light cannot be controlled, and that is usually the case with \nhigh lumens devices. These units will be fairly loud due to the fact that the fan will have to work hard to cool off the \nlamp, baffling can be installed to quiet them down a bit. I can't stress enough that lumens should not be the deciding \nfactor in choosing a projector for Jeff's media room, you'll probably get a sun tan and need sunglasses while watching \neither one of these models. \nAgain if Jeff wants an image that is close to 35mm film in sharpness and detail the JVC is the way to go at his price point. \nAs I stated earlier the JVC is compared to the newer version of Jeff's current Sony (that is broken), the new Sony VPL-\nVW1000ES is priced at about $25000. \nDigital Projections E Vision \nLumens 8000 \nContrast ratio 2400:1 \n$18891 \n10/Default.aspx\nOptoma TH 7500 \nEFTA00647142\nLumens 6000 \nContrast ratio 2000:1 \n$11000 \nJeff 5ternhell \nVice President \nCutting Ed e S stems \nFrom: Richard Kahn [Sent: Thursday, July 26, 2012 10:41 AM \nTo: Jeff Sternhell \nCc: \nSubject: Re: projector \nany updates on new recommendations? \nthank you \nPLEASE NOTE EFFECTIVE JUNE 5TH MY CONTACT INFO WILL BE AS FOLLOWS: \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor, \nNew York, New York 10022 \ntel \nth) \nce"

This projector is also 3D ready. \nI feel totally comfortable recommending this projector especially with it working within \nthe confines of the price specified by the principal.

          "body": "Hi Richard, \nThe 2 projectors that we would recommend with higher lumens are Digital Projections E \nVision and Optoma TH 7500, I will go into specs below. These 2 models are geared more \nfor commercial applications in large rooms such as showrooms and corporate \npresentations where ambient light cannot be controlled, and that is usually the case \nwith high lumens devices. These units will be fairly loud due to the fact that the fan will \nhave to work hard to cool off the lamp, baffling can be installed to quiet them down a \nbit. I can't stress enough that lumens should not be the deciding factor in choosing a \nprojector for Jeffs media room, you'll probably get a sun tan and need sunglasses while \nwatching either one of these models. \nAgain if Jeff wants an image that is close to 35mm film in sharpness and detail the JVC is \nthe way to go at his price point. As I stated earlier the JVC is compared to the newer \nversion of Jeff's current Sony (that is broken), the new Sony VPL-VW1000ES is priced at \nabout $25000. \nDigital Projections E Vision \nLumens 8000 \nContrast ratio 2400:1 \n$18891 \nImp: .1www.digitalprojcction.com/BrowseProjectorsiScriesList/Projectorl.ist tabid.

He'll star opposite Eva Green and Susan Sarandon. \nWriter-director Nicholas Jarecki is set to start principal photography in Gotham next spring. \nMichael Ohoven (\"Capote\") is producing and financing through his Infinity Media banner. Kevin Turen and Robert Salerno also are \nproducers. \nLisa Wilson's Parlay Films, an affiliate of GK Films, is selling international rights and will debut the project at the American Film \nMarket. ICM is repping North American rights. \nLaura Bickford (\"Traffic\") and Brian Young (\"The Runaways\") are exec producing the pic. \n\"Arbitrage\" stars Pacino as a hedge fund magnate who is in over his head and desperate to complete the sale of his trading empire \nto a major bank before his fraud is revealed. But an unexpected, bloody error forces him to turn to the most unlikely corner for \nhelp. \nForeign buyers have shown keen interest in financial dramas in the wake of the economic collapse of late 2008. Myriad Pictures has \nseen brisk sales for Kevin Spacey-Jeremy Irons-Zachary Quinto topliner \"Margin Call,\" which will also be at AFM. \nOther upcoming Pacino projects include Sony's Adam Sandler comedy \"Jack and Jill,\" which is eyeing a November start date. He's \nalso circling a \"King Lear\" project. He was last in theaters in 2008 in \"Righteous Kill.\" \nSarandon was most recently seen in 20th Century Fox's \"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.\" \nGreen (\"Casino Royale,\" \"The Golden Compass\") is in production on the \"Camelot\" series for Starz and GK-TV. \nEFTA00752152\nJarecki's credits include docu \"The Outsider\" featuring James Toback. He also co-wrote \"The Informers\" with Bret Easton Ellis. He's \nthe brother of filmmakers Andrew and Eugene Jarecki. \nOhoven is in post-production on \"The Fields,\" starring Sam Worthington. \nInfinity will next produce and finance psychological thriller \"The Door,\" which begins lensing later this month. \nContact Pamela McClintock ai \nNicholas Jarecki \nThe Green Room \n--- End of Forwarded Message \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

I \nhave also included the plan as an excel file so you can tweak it to your liking;) The numbers aren't perfect but they are within \nstriking distance and I've done a lot of work to vet them and get them here, considering every possible cost and revenue source. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned my current equity investor (Michael Ohoven) announced to me yesterday that he will not take any \npartners and will only shoot the film for 10MM all-in (including finance) in Louisiana with 26 shooting days, 3 of them in New York, \nwith me not having much say on anything. He is asking me to sign over all rights now. He has some special deal in Lousiana that I \ndon't even want to know about and I think that's his big motivation. \nOf course, I have no idea whether Al or the rest of the cast would go to Lousiana and if Lisa Wilson my sales agent would be able to \npreserve her sales figures if we shot there. I feel creatively the film should be shot in NYC, especially as I have all my free toys there I \ncan provide to enhance its feeling. \nI'm open to any arrangement that works for you. I have the passion to see this movie through and make it with heart and beauty in \nNew York, in the incredible locations I can provide for free, with the great cast that has come to play. Lost week the hip-hop \nsensation \"Drake\" signed on to playJimmy! He's a wonderful guy and will do great work (and work hard to promote the movie and \nsubstantially raise our American media and viewing profile.) \nKevin Turen (my creative producer and partner from the film's genesis) and I have committed to put up 500k in equity each. He and \nI have also deferred all of our producing fees, and I have deferred my writing and directing fee entirely. \nIn the last week I have faced the inevitable; I have begun cutting the script with my teacher, and we have artfully rewritten pages \n(we're not there yet, but we'll get to 105 pages) and the budget down to an achievable 9.5MM for a 29 day shoot in NYC that would \nstart March 21st. \nThe attached plan assumes we can get a bank loan after fees and discounts of about 6MM. I don't have term sheets, but I have \nkicked the tires on these numbers pretty well and believe they will hold up. I'm trying to get term sheets now (but with holidays it is \ntough this week). My excellent line producer Bob Salerno (\"A Single Man,\" \"21 Grams\") is already in process with a company called \nTCF on tax credit finance bids for New York. \nWe will need about 3.8MM in equity to finance the remainder of the film. As Kevin and I will put up 1MM together, we need an \nadditional 2.8MM in equity. \nI believe we will recoup and go into profit based on this plan, as it only assumes a 1.1MM US sale and there are about 2.8MM \nworth of unloaned foreign sales and tax credits to collect upon, assuming no overages in foreign sales. You asked how we could \nmake money: we could get it by doing better on foreign sales (as they will certainly increase from showing and selling completed \nfootage to buyers if I deliver a quality film— right now they have only bought a piece of paper- so when I show footage if it is good \nthey will pay more— of course you have to believe I will make a good movie!) We could also make money through a higher US sale. \nSales recently have been as high as 5mm and some decent films (like Rabbit Hole with Nicole Kidman) have gone for 3mm- we're \nonly projecting 1.1mm. Finally one could force it straight to DVD, and I believe with this cast collect at least 2mm just from that, and \nalready be 1mm in profit. I believe the downside risk of the equity is 1mm (we'd have to really mess up to have 0 domestic sale or \ndrastically reduced remaining foreign)- and the upside is probably 2mm at least (lm increase on foreign, and lm increase on \ndomestic). Another way to go would be to self-distribute domestically, and put up our own P&A (although this is tricky and will \nrequire a couple million more spend- but could result in 5mm upside— and it's a decision that can be made down the line). \nIf you thought any of this plan made sense, we would be ready to go, and the moves would be: to sign off (we can execute contracts \nvery quickly), fund some prep (200k of work to start scouting and working on the movie in mid-December in NYC), and make Al pay \nor play for our March 21st shoot (his agent Jeff Berg is screaming for his 1.8mm money guarnatee now!) in order to keep our dates \nand our principal actor. \nWe would shoot March 21 in NYC for about 30 days over 6 weeks. We'd then edit and post the film in New York over a 3 month \nperiod. We'd probably be ready to deliver it around March 2012. \nOne additional option would be also take out the bank position, which would save at least 714k in fees and a lot of headache. But it \nrequires a lot more commitment (an additional 6mm)- so we can table that and know it will work without it. \nIf you came in you could executive produce or produce the film, and come on set, go to all premieres, receive awards, all the nice \nfun stuff. \nFinally our foreign sales agent Lisa is currently at deal 7.5% upfront fees of her sales (7.5% deferred) plus 150k market fee in these \nprojections. I believe if we were serious we could ask her to defer a bit more, but who knows. \nEFTA00752151\nI thank you very much for looking at all this. As my current partner has put a gun to my head, I do need to give him a yes by next \nTuesday, or risk no movie at all. Of course, I'd love to tell him goodbye. \nHave a great Thanksgiving, and no matter the answer- I appreciate you looking at this all. I expect nothing. \nGive my dad a hug for me. \nBest, \nNick \nPS please note attached budget is 10.65mm- but we have down to 9.5-10mm- still working with my guy to redo the numbers but \nthey are really there- just don't have document finished yet- and numbers are real. \nPPS This may be in \"movie shorthand\" so I can walk through in detail anything that doesn't just make sense.

I \nhave also included the plan as an excel file so you can tweak it to your liking;) The numbers aren't perfect but they are within \nstriking distance and I've done a lot of work to vet them and get them here, considering every possible cost and revenue source. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned my current equity investor (Michael Ohoven) announced to me yesterday that he will not take any \npartners and will only shoot the film for 10MM all-in (including finance) in Louisiana with 26 shooting days, 3 of them in New York, \nwith me not having much say on anything. He is asking me to sign over all rights now. He has some special deal in Lousiana that I \ndon't even want to know about and I think that's his big motivation. \nEFTA00776681\nOf course, I have no idea whether Al or the rest of the cast would go to Lousiana and if Lisa Wilson my sales agent would be able to \npreserve her sales figures if we shot there. I feel creatively the film should be shot in NYC, especially as I have all my free toys there I \ncan provide to enhance its feeling. \nI'm open to any arrangement that works for you. I have the passion to see this movie through and make it with heart and beauty in \nNew York, in the incredible locations I can provide for free, with the great cast that has come to play. Lost week the hip-hop \nsensation \"Drake\" signed on to play Jimmy! He's a wonderful guy and will do great work (and work hard to promote the movie and \nsubstantially raise our American media and viewing profile.) \nKevin Turen (my creative producer and partner from the film's genesis) and I have committed to put up 500k in equity each. He and \nI have also deferred all of our producing fees, and I have deferred my writing and directing fee entirely. \nIn the last week I have faced the inevitable; I have begun cutting the script with my teacher, and we have artfully rewritten pages \n(we're not there yet, but we'll get to 105 pages) and the budget down to an achievable 9.5MM for a 29 day shoot in NYC that would \nstart March 21st. \nThe attached plan assumes we can get a bank loan after fees and discounts of about 6MM. I don't have term sheets, but I have \nkicked the tires on these numbers pretty well and believe they will hold up. I'm trying to get term sheets now (but with holidays it is \ntough this week). My excellent line producer Bob Salerno (\"A Single Man,\" \"21 Grams\") is already in process with a company called \nTCF on tax credit finance bids for New York. \nWe will need about 3.8MM in equity to finance the remainder of the film. As Kevin and I will put up 1MM together, we need an \nadditional 2.8MM in equity. \nI believe we will recoup and go into profit based on this plan, as it only assumes a 1.1MM US sale and there are about 2.8MM \nworth of unloaned foreign sales and tax credits to collect upon, assuming no overages in foreign sales. You asked how we could \nmake money: we could get it by doing better on foreign sales (as they will certainly increase from showing and selling completed \nfootage to buyers if I deliver a quality film— right now they have only bought a piece of paper- so when I show footage if it is good \nthey will pay more— of course you have to believe I will make a good movie!) We could also make money through a higher US sale. \nSales recently have been as high as 5mm and some decent films (like Rabbit Hole with Nicole Kidman) have gone for 3mm- we're \nonly projecting 1.1mm. Finally one could force it straight to DVD, and I believe with this cast collect at least 2mm just from that, and \nalready be 1mm in profit. I believe the downside risk of the equity is 1mm (we'd have to really mess up to have 0 domestic sale or \ndrastically reduced remaining foreign)- and the upside is probably 2mm at least (lm increase on foreign, and lm increase on \ndomestic). Another way to go would be to self-distribute domestically, and put up our own P&A (although this is tricky and will \nrequire a couple million more spend- but could result in 5mm upside— and it's a decision that can be made down the line). \nIf you thought any of this plan made sense, we would be ready to go, and the moves would be: to sign off (we can execute contracts \nvery quickly), fund some prep (200k of work to start scouting and working on the movie in mid-December in NYC), and make Al pay \nor play for our March 21st shoot (his agent Jeff Berg is screaming for his 1.8mm money guarnatee now!) in order to keep our dates \nand our principal actor. \nWe would shoot March 21 in NYC for about 30 days over 6 weeks. We'd then edit and post the film in New York over a 3 month \nperiod. We'd probably be ready to deliver it around March 2012. \nOne additional option would be also take out the bank position, which would save at least 714k in fees and a lot of headache. But it \nrequires a lot more commitment (an additional 6mm)- so we can table that and know it will work without it. \nIf you came in you could executive produce or produce the film, and come on set, go to all premieres, receive awards, all the nice \nfun stuff. \nFinally our foreign sales agent Lisa is currently at deal 7.5% upfront fees of her sales (7.5% deferred) plus 150k market fee in these \nprojections. I believe if we were serious we could ask her to defer a bit more, but who knows. \nI thank you very much for looking at all this. As my current partner has put a gun to my head, I do need to give him a yes by next \nTuesday, or risk no movie at all. Of course, I'd love to tell him goodbye. \nHave a great Thanksgiving, and no matter the answer- I appreciate you looking at this all. I expect nothing. \nGive my dad a hug for me. \nBest, \nEFTA00776682\nNick \nPS please note attached budget is 10.65mm- but we have down to 9.5-10mm- still working with my guy to redo the numbers but \nthey are really there- just don't have document finished yet- and numbers are real. \nPPS This may be in \"movie shorthand\" so I can walk through in detail anything that doesn't just make sense.

As Kevin and I will put up 1MM together, we need an \nadditional 2.8MM in equity. \nI believe we will recoup and go into profit based on this plan, as it only assumes a 1.1MM US sale and there are about 2.8MM worth \nof unloaned foreign sales and tax credits to collect upon, assuming no overages in foreign sales. You asked how we could make money: \nwe could get it by doing better on foreign sales (as they will certainly increase from showing and selling completed footage to buyers if \nI deliver a quality film— right now they have only bought a piece of paper- so when I show footage if it is good they will pay more— of \ncourse you have to believe I will make a good movie!) We could also make money through a higher US sale. Sales recently have been \nas high as 5mm and some decent films (like Rabbit Hole with Nicole Kidman) have gone for 3mm- we're only projecting 1.1mm. Finally \none could force it straight to DVD, and I believe with this cast collect at least 2mm just from that, and already be 1mm in profit. I \nbelieve the downside risk of the equity is 1mm (we'd have to really mess up to have 0 domestic sale or drastically reduced remaining \nforeign)- and the upside is probably 2mm at least (lm increase on foreign, and lm increase on domestic). Another way to go would be \nto self-distribute domestically, and put up our own P&A (although this is tricky and will require a couple million more spend- but could \nresult in Smm upside— and it's a decision that can be made down the line). \nIf you thought any of this plan made sense, we would be ready to go, and the moves would be: to sign off (we can execute contracts \nvery quickly), fund some prep (200k of work to start scouting and working on the movie in mid-December in NYC), and make Al pay or \nplay for our March 21st shoot (his agent Jeff Berg is screaming for his 1.8mm money guarnatee now!) in order to keep our dates and \nour principal actor. \nWe would shoot March 21 in NYC for about 30 days over 6 weeks. We'd then edit and post the film in New York over a 3 month \nperiod. We'd probably be ready to deliver it around March 2012. \nOne additional option would be also take out the bank position, which would save at least 714k in fees and a lot of headache. But it \nrequires a lot more commitment (an additional 6mm)- so we can table that and know it will work without it. \nIf you came in you could executive produce or produce the film, and come on set, go to all premieres, receive awards, all the nice fun \nstuff. \nFinally our foreign sales agent Lisa is currently at deal 7.5% upfront fees of her sales (7.5% deferred) plus 150k market fee in these \nprojections. I believe if we were serious we could ask her to defer a bit more, but who knows. \nI thank you very much for looking at all this. As my current partner has put a gun to my head, I do need to give him a yes by next \nTuesday, or risk no movie at all. Of course, I'd love to tell him goodbye. \nHave a great Thanksgiving, and no matter the answer- I appreciate you looking at this all. I expect nothing. \nGive my dad a hug for me. \nBest, \nNick \nPS please note attached budget is 10.6Smm- but we have down to 9.S-l0mm- still working with my guy to redo the numbers but they \nEFTA00752155\nare really there- just don't have document finished yet- and numbers are real. \nPPS This may be in \"movie shorthand\" so I can walk through in detail anything that doesn't just make sense. I also have all the real \npeople to talk to available at a moment's notice."

However, can you provide me with 10,000 word real interviews with all \nthese scientists with that much content, questions (real or not) in the time you wanted? Today, \ntomorrow? Early next week? Seriously ... we know what we are doing. \nThere is a TREMENDOUS time crunch here to get this out fast as possible. so you can get results \nas quickly as possible. In time, of course, it will be constructed with other scientists too, both ones \nyou know and ones that you don't know, and should, and in your own voice. \nThe purpose of this is for the search engines, which means, I made it deliberately long, I broke up \nyour questions repeatedly, and repeated your name over and over in a way that wasn't obvious for \nwhat we were trying to accomplish. The fastest first path is the one we are taking. I used my \ninterview first, because I could control it, and I could write it easily, and it had real content, not \npseudo-content, and get it up by today. \nJust fyi, it took me several hours to get Murray to give me only two sentences that I could use. \nOther interviews will be going up, but they are in process of being made. I have asked for \nmaterials from your side, but I can't use just names and generalities if you want this to be effective. \nOk, so, I know most of the people and their work that you are referring to, but I have to build the \ncontent for them, and as these are serious people, it needs to be done correctly. Otherwise, it \nlooks bad on them and bad on you, and we don't want any more of that. \nI am happy to correct any of your questions to put them in \"your voice\" if you want to take the time \nto make such edits. In the meantime, let us get this up there, and when you have the time and \ninclination, we can happily change it. None of this needs to be etched in stone, other than for the \nexpress purpose of achieving your goal. \nIf you have any existing interviews with anyone that are transcribed or otherwise, I sure would \nneed it asap. \nI have my teams actually pulling all nighters. I haven't slept for 48 hours working non-stop on this. \nSo, please Jeff, we are all pulling for you very hard. Myself especially... I don't make a single \npenny on this. \nI know that all of this is frustrating and horribly invasive. I know that you are private. We have to \nwork with the constraints of the system, and we have already gotten discernable results. \nI will write more later. \nBest, \nme \nFrom: Jeffrey E stein \nTo: Al seckel < \nEFTA00754422\nSent: Sat, October 16, 2010 8:37:09 PM \nSubject: Re: I hope you enjoy this \nwhy don't we construct more with other scientists. with real questions and my real voice."

You give me the remaining stuff for \nscience, I'll generate content for sports. We also need asap at least two articles (400+ words) \non Jeffrey Epstein and Science from you. (I'll take care of the sports) Philippines are continuing to \ndo a lot of backend work, with additional work as soon as they receive the articles and photos from \nJeff. The sooner this happens, the more likely we have a shot of getting ranked by end of the \nmonth. This activity will be ongoing through the end of the month. Sports blog will continue after \nthat. Science blog should also continue after that as well. \nOnce additional money comes in I can continue to start pimping the \"other\" Jeffrey Epsteins that \nalready exist on the web, trying to jump them up in rankings. We will also be working simultaneously \nto get other Jeffrey Epstein photos to appear in Google Search results \nWe are also working on the JeffreyEpstein.org which will be the charity site. I need similar extensive \nand specific content on his charitable work. Also, we will do a mobile version of the science site so \nthat we can dominate mobile searches. \nThen i will \nbuild jeffreyepsteinforbes.com jeffreyepsteinvanityfair.com jeffreyepsteindeposition.com jeffreyepste \nindailybeast.com sites which will give a positive spin on these news articles (NOTE: These are \nsearch terms that come up via google instant or google suggest so they must be addressed) \nWe are continuing trying to tweak the Wikipedia process. He has over twenty people with google \nalerts on him, who go and undo our edits every time we remove material. We will have to take some \nmore extreme measures, but this will be easier with links once the other sites are up and functional. \nWe also need tol create another Jeffrey Epstein site (with videos) which should help alleviate some \nof the video search results. \nAs you know there will be lots of work on the backend to generate links to ensure the sites we are \npromoting (both our own Jeffrey Epstein and \"other\" Jeffrey Epstein websites) so they end up on the \nfirst page of Google. \nThe key is to do things strategically, with regularity, and not always all at once. You've already seen \nthe kind of work effort I will bring to this project, so I'm counting on you to make this happen and \nprovide me the material and funding that I need. \nFrom: Jeffrey E stein \nTo: Al seckel \nSent: Sun, October 17, 2010 1:46:08 AM \nSubject: Re: I hope you enjoy this \nEFTA00754421\ni am patient , and excited to see the results of your efforts."
